Overview NA
At its meeting on 6 March 2025, the Governing Council decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. In particular, the decision to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which the Governing Council steers the monetary policy stance – is based on its updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. NA
The disinflation process is well on track. Inflation has continued to develop broadly as staff expected, and the March 2025 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area closely align with the previous inflation outlook. Staff now see headline inflation averaging 2.3% in 2025, 1.9% in 2026 and 2.0% in 2027. The upward revision in headline inflation for 2025 reflects stronger energy price dynamics. For inflation excluding energy and food, staff project an average of 2.2% in 2025, 2.0% in 2026 and 1.9% in 2027. NA
Most measures of underlying inflation suggest that inflation will settle at around the Governing Council’s 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis. Domestic inflation remains high, mostly because wages and prices in certain sectors are still adjusting to the past inflation surge with a substantial delay. But wage growth is moderating as expected, and profits are partially buffering the impact on inflation. NA
Monetary policy is becoming meaningfully less restrictive, as the interest rate cuts are making new borrowing less expensive for firms and households and loan growth is picking up. At the same time, a headwind to the easing of financing conditions comes from past interest rate hikes still transmitting to the stock of credit, and lending remains subdued overall. The economy faces continued challenges and staff have again marked down their growth projections – to 0.9% for 2025, 1.2% for 2026 and 1.3% for 2027. The downward revisions for 2025 and 2026 reflect lower exports and ongoing weakness in investment, in part originating from high trade policy uncertainty as well as broader policy uncertainty. Rising real incomes and the gradually fading effects of past rate hikes remain the key drivers underpinning the expected pick-up in demand over time. NA
The Governing Council is determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at its 2% medium-term target. Especially in current conditions of rising uncertainty, it will follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance. In particular, the Governing Council’s interest rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path. NA
Economic activity NA
The euro area economy likely grew modestly in the fourth quarter of 2024. The first two months of 2025 saw a continuation of many of the previous year’s patterns. Manufacturing is still a drag on growth even if survey indicators are improving. High uncertainty, both at home and abroad, is holding back investment and competitiveness challenges are weighing on exports. At the same time, services are resilient. Moreover, rising household incomes and the robust labour market are supporting a gradual pick-up in consumption, although consumer confidence is still fragile and saving rates are high. NA
The unemployment rate stayed at its historical low of 6.2% in January 2025, and employment is estimated to have grown by 0.1% in the last quarter of 2024. However, demand for labour has moderated, and recent survey data suggest that employment growth was subdued in the first two months of 2025. NA
Persistently high geopolitical and policy uncertainty is expected to weigh on euro area economic growth, especially in investment and exports, slowing down the anticipated recovery. This follows slightly weaker than expected growth at the end of 2024. Both domestic and trade policy uncertainty are high. Although the baseline projection only includes the impact of new tariffs on trade between the United States and China, the negative effects of uncertainty regarding the possibility of further changes in global trade policies, particularly vis-à-vis the European Union, are assumed to weigh on euro area exports and investment. This, coupled with persistent competitiveness challenges, is assessed to lead to a further decline in the euro area’s export market share. Despite these headwinds, the conditions remain in place for euro area GDP growth to strengthen again over the projection horizon. Rising real wages and employment, in the context of a strong, albeit cooling, labour market, are expected to support a recovery in which consumption remains a key contributor to growth. Domestic demand should also be supported by an easing of financing conditions, as implied by market expectations about the future path of interest rates. The labour market should remain resilient, with the unemployment rate expected to average 6.3% in 2025, edging down to 6.2% in 2027. As some of the cyclical factors that have recently reduced productivity start to unwind, productivity is expected to pick up over the projection horizon, although structural challenges remain. Overall, annual average real GDP growth is expected to be 0.9% in 2025, and to strengthen to 1.2% in 2026 and to 1.3% in 2027. Compared with the December 2024 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, the outlook for GDP growth has been revised down by 0.2 percentage points for both 2025 and 2026, but is unchanged for 2027. The weaker outlook is mainly due to downward revisions to exports and, to a lesser extent, to investment, reflecting a stronger impact of uncertainty than previously assumed, as well as expectations that competitiveness challenges will likely persist for longer than had been anticipated. NA
Fiscal and structural policies should make the economy more productive, competitive and resilient. The European Commission’s Competitiveness Compass provides a concrete roadmap for action and its proposals should be swiftly adopted. Governments should ensure sustainable public finances in line with the EU’s economic governance framework and prioritise essential growth-enhancing structural reforms and strategic investment. NA
Inflation NA
According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual inflation stood at 2.4% in February 2025, after 2.5% in January and 2.4% in December 2024. Energy price inflation slowed to 0.2%, following a strong increase to 1.9% in January, from 0.1% in December. By contrast, food price inflation rose to 2.7%, from 2.3% in January and 2.6% in December. Goods inflation ticked up to 0.6%, while services inflation eased to 3.7%, from 3.9% in January and 4.0% in December. NA
Most indicators of underlying inflation are pointing to a sustained return of inflation to the Governing Council’s 2% medium-term target. Domestic inflation, which closely tracks services inflation, declined in January 2025. But it remains high, as wages and some services prices are still adjusting to the past inflation surge with a substantial delay. At the same time, recent wage negotiations point to a continued moderation in labour cost pressures. NA
Headline HICP inflation has increased over recent months but is projected to moderate marginally in the course of 2025 and then to decline and hover around the Governing Council’s inflation target of 2% from the first quarter of 2026. At the start of the projection horizon upward base effects in the energy component and higher food price inflation are expected to broadly offset downward impacts from a decline in HICP inflation excluding energy and food (HICPX). The rise in energy commodity prices at the turn of the year will carry over into the annual rate of change in energy prices in 2025. Although oil and gas prices are assumed to decline in line with futures prices, energy inflation is likely to continue to record positive rates, albeit below the historical average, over the entire projection horizon. In 2027 energy inflation is seen to be driven up by the introduction of new climate change mitigation measures. Food inflation is projected to rise until mid-2025, mainly driven by recent robust increases in food commodity prices, before declining to stand at an average of 2.2% in 2027. HICPX inflation is expected to start to decline in early 2025 as the effects of lagged repricing fade, wage pressures recede and the impact from past monetary policy tightening continues to feed through to consumer prices. The decline in HICPX inflation is expected to be mainly driven by a decrease in services inflation – which has thus far been relatively persistent. Overall, HICPX inflation is projected to moderate from 2.2% in 2025 to 1.9% in 2027. Wage growth should continue to follow a downward path from the current still elevated levels as inflation compensation pressures fade. Coupled with the anticipated recovery in productivity growth, this is expected to lead to significantly slower growth in unit labour costs. As a result, domestic price pressures are projected to continue to ease, with profit margins recovering over the projection horizon. External price pressures, as reflected in import prices, are expected to remain moderate assuming that EU trade tariff policies remain unchanged. Compared with the December 2024 projections, the outlook for headline HICP inflation has been revised up by 0.2 percentage points for 2025 on account of higher energy commodity price assumptions and the depreciation of the euro, while it has been marginally revised down for 2027 owing to a slightly weaker outlook for the energy component at the end of the horizon. NA
In summary, the assumption of higher energy price inflation led staff to revise up the headline inflation projection for 2025. At the same time, staff expect core inflation to continue slowing, as labour cost pressures ease further and the past monetary policy tightening continues to weigh on prices. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations continue to stand at around 2%. All of these factors will support the sustainable return of inflation to the Governing Council’s target. NA
Risk assessment NA
The risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. An escalation in trade tensions would lower euro area growth by dampening exports and weakening the global economy. Ongoing uncertainty about global trade policies could drag investment down. Geopolitical tensions, such as Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East, remain a major source of uncertainty as well. Growth could be lower if the lagged effects of monetary policy tightening last longer than expected. At the same time, growth could be higher if easier financing conditions and falling inflation allow domestic consumption and investment to rebound faster. An increase in defence and infrastructure spending could also add to growth. NA
Increasing friction in global trade is adding more uncertainty to the outlook for euro area inflation. A general escalation in trade tensions could see the euro depreciate and import costs rise, which would put upward pressure on inflation. At the same time, lower demand for euro area exports as a result of higher tariffs and a re-routing of exports into the euro area from countries with overcapacity would put downward pressure on inflation. Geopolitical tensions create two-sided inflation risks as regards energy markets, consumer confidence and business investment. Extreme weather events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices by more than expected. Inflation could turn out higher if wages or profits increase by more than expected. A boost in defence and infrastructure spending could also raise inflation through its effect on aggregate demand. But inflation might surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampens demand by more than expected. NA
Financial and monetary conditions NA
Market interest rates in the euro area decreased after the Governing Council’s meeting on 30 January 2025, but rose in the run-up to its meeting on 6 March in response to a revised outlook for fiscal policy. The interest rate cuts are gradually making it less expensive for firms and households to borrow and loan growth is picking up. At the same time, a headwind to the easing of financing conditions comes from past interest rate hikes still transmitting to the stock of credit, and lending remains subdued overall. NA
The average interest rate on new loans to firms declined to 4.2% in January 2025, from 4.4% in December 2024. By contrast, firms’ cost of issuing market-based debt rose to 3.7%, 0.2 percentage points above its December level. Over the same period, the average interest rate on new mortgages declined to 3.3%, from 3.4%. NA
Growth in bank lending to firms rose to 2.0% in January, up from 1.7% in December, on the back of a moderate monthly flow of new loans. Growth in debt securities issued by firms rose to 3.4% in annual terms. Mortgage lending continued to rise gradually but remained muted overall, with an annual growth rate of 1.3%. NA
Monetary policy decisions NA
The interest rates on the deposit facility, the main refinancing operations and the marginal lending facility were decreased to 2.50%, 2.65% and 2.90% respectively, with effect from 12 March 2025. NA
The asset purchase programme and pandemic emergency purchase programme portfolios are declining at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem no longer reinvests the principal payments from maturing securities. NA
Conclusion NA
At its meeting on 6 March 2025, the Governing Council decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. In particular, the decision to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which the Governing Council steers the monetary policy stance – is based on its updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The Governing Council is determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at its 2% medium-term target. Especially in current conditions of rising uncertainty, it will follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance. In particular, the Governing Council’s interest rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path. NA
In any case, the Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at its medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission. NA
1 External environment NA
NA NA
Although still in expansionary territory, the global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) (excluding the euro area) declined in February 2025 due to a slowdown in the services sector (Chart 1), which had been the primary driver of growth in the second half of 2024. The drop in services sentiment was broad-based across major economies, but most pronounced in the United States. Overall, the latest ECB staff nowcasting model for global GDP, which incorporates a broad range of macroeconomic indicators in addition to PMIs, continues to point to steady growth of around 1.0% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2025. Nevertheless, near-term growth prospects are clouded by the recent changes to US trade policy, which implied not only the imposition of new tariffs on China but also an increase in trade policy uncertainty, which is expected to act as a drag on global investment. Growth in global activity remained steady at the turn of the year, but recent shifts in the US trade policy stance may imply stronger headwinds to come.
NA NA
Global real GDP is projected to grow by 3.4% in 2025 before decreasing to 3.2% in 2026-27. While the precise timing and scope of recent US trade policy announcements are still unclear, the March 2025 ECB staff macroeconomic projections incorporate the tariffs imposed by the United States on imports from China – which came into force on 4 February (i.e. before the projections cut-off date of 19 February 2025) – and retaliatory measures by China. Compared with the December 2024 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, global growth has been revised down by 0.1 percentage point for 2025 and 2026, as the newly imposed tariffs and higher trade policy uncertainty are expected to weigh on activity. In 2026-27, the slight decline in global GDP growth reflects slower growth in China amid unfavourable demographic dynamics, and in the United States due to the negative medium-term impact of US policies (e.g. lower immigration). Downside risks to the global outlook prevail, driven by the threat of more US tariffs (e.g. levies on steel and aluminium, as well as tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union) and prevailing geopolitical tensions. The outlook for global activity growth is projected to remain moderate, easing slightly over the projection horizon.
While the mild improvement in manufacturing sentiment and industrial production can support global trade dynamics in the first quarter of 2025, growth in global activity at the turn of the year was driven mainly by components with low trade intensity, i.e. public and private consumption. In addition, elevated trade policy uncertainty and slower monetary policy easing in the United States are expected to weigh on investment in the future, affecting trade disproportionately as investment tends to be highly trade intensive. Moreover, the frontloading of trade – which supported global trade in 2024, as firms in the United States in particular stockpiled imports of foreign inputs ahead of possible trade disruptions – is expected to gradually fade in 2025 as new tariffs take effect. A partial unwinding of the frontloading of imports is also expected to weigh on demand throughout 2025, mostly across the advanced economies that frontloaded imports from emerging markets in 2024. Lastly, trade flows are expected to be significantly affected by tariffs over the projection horizon, with the March 2025 projections entailing large downward revisions to imports and exports in the United States and China by a cumulated 1.0-1.5 percentage points each over 2025-27. Against this background, growth in euro area foreign demand is projected to moderate from 3.4% in 2024 to 3.2% in 2025 and to 3.1% in 2026 and 2027, with significant downward revisions compared with the December 2024 projections. Global trade growth moderated at the end of 2024 and is projected to slow amid the impact of tariffs, elevated trade policy uncertainty, a less favourable composition of demand and an unwinding of the earlier frontloading of imports.
The outlook for trade is clouded by uncertainty, as protectionism could significantly hamper cross-border flows. US tariffs on Canada and Mexico would affect around one-third of total US imports of goods and around three-quarters of total goods exported by Canada and Mexico, with the impact of tariffs likely to be amplified by the interconnected nature of supply chains across North America. On 10 February, the US administration announced a 25% tariff on steel and aluminium entering the United States, effective as of 12 March. Despite the small share of these goods in US imports (2%), US consumers and industries located downstream in supply chains (e.g. the automotive industry) are expected to be negatively affected. Furthermore, President Trump instructed his advisers to devise a comprehensive plan for reciprocal tariffs on 12 February, and announced global tariffs on cars, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors on 18 February. On 21 February he argued in favour of a review of trade partners’ tariffs on US digital services, announced a 25% tariff on European imports on 26 February and an additional 10% levy on China on 27 February. The ongoing escalation of trade tensions poses risks to the smooth functioning of existing trade networks.
In January 2025 the annual rate of consumer price index (CPI) inflation across OECD members (excluding Türkiye) rose to 3.0%, up from 2.9% the previous month (Chart 2). This uptick in headline CPI inflation was partly due to higher energy prices, with the contribution of food prices remaining broadly stable. Core CPI inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, increased slightly to 3.1%. Headline inflation across OECD member countries has increased amid a slight increase in core inflation.
NA NA
Although the disinflation process across OECD members appears to have stalled at the end of 2024, CPI inflation across a broader group of advanced and emerging countries in the March 2025 projections is expected to decline gradually from 4.2% in 2024 to 2.5% in 2027. The cooling of labour markets across OECD members is expected to drive down nominal wage inflation, allowing headline CPI inflation to gradually converge towards central bank targets. Compared with the December 2024 projections, headline CPI inflation across a broader group of advanced and emerging countries is expected to be higher in 2025, reflecting the pass-through of tariffs to consumer prices in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in China. For 2026 and 2027, CPI inflation across global economies has been revised down, as the upward impact of tariffs is more than compensated by other factors, mainly downward revisions to CPI inflation in China, reflecting entrenched deflation in producer prices amid a lingering oversupply. Notwithstanding the recent uptick across OECD members, CPI inflation across a broader group of advanced and emerging countries is projected to remain on a declining path over the projection horizon.
Concerns about the impact of trade disputes on global activity exerted downward pressure on oil prices, which was further reinforced by an unexpected build-up in US crude oil inventories, indicating weaker-than-expected demand for oil in the United States. European gas prices experienced strong volatility, as colder temperatures and a low renewable energy output led initially to higher prices owing to an increase in the amount of gas consumed for heating and to generate power. However, gas spot prices declined as a result of announcements about Ukraine peace negotiations. Downward price pressures have also been reinforced by milder weather and by LNG tankers being redirected towards Europe. Metal prices increased by 2%, mainly as a result of US-based traders making precautionary purchases following the announcements made on 10 February regarding steel and aluminium tariffs, along with threats made on 25 February to impose levies on imported copper. Lastly, food prices declined by 2%, as cocoa prices corrected downward slightly after surging in late 2024 and early 2025. Over the review period, Brent crude oil prices decreased by 5%, while European gas prices declined by 12%.
Real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 (0.6% quarter-on-quarter) was mainly driven by private consumption owing to higher real disposable incomes, while business investment fell. In the first quarter of 2025 the latest ECB staff nowcast for US GDP expects growth to remain robust at 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. The financial constraints affecting US consumers appear to be growing, although the knock-on effects on consumption seem limited. While credit card defaults have risen to above their pre-pandemic averages, the number of consumer foreclosures and bankruptcies remains low by historical comparison, and the household debt service ratio remains close to pre-pandemic levels. In addition, the largest increase in credit card defaults relates to lower-income households, who account for only 12% of total consumer spending. On the nominal side, although the January CPI release was higher than expected, it hints at a decline in both headline and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation in the near term, which is also supported by the recent deceleration in the producer price index (PPI). Overall, key sources of inflation are cooling in the United States, where labour market tightness indicators have steadily declined back to their pre-pandemic levels. Still, the inflation outlook remains subject to significant uncertainty, and US policies could further slow the gradual disinflation, as tariffs on US imports are expected to be passed through to consumer prices, while stricter immigration and deportations risk a renewed tightening of the labour market. Against this backdrop, US consumers have started to increase their short and long-term inflation expectations, which in turn may further slow the disinflationary process. Finally, the Federal Open Market Committee decided at its January meeting to keep the federal funds rate unchanged, signalling no hurry to adjust the interest rate, given the still robust economy. The March 2025 ECB staff projections foresee activity in the United States remaining solid in the near term led by strong growth in consumption, although risks from US policies are accumulating.
Following the pick-up in real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2024, latest indicators point to a slowdown in both manufacturing and services activity. A high frequency indicator for private consumption declined in January 2025, suggesting that the boost from previous fiscal support was short lived. Consumer confidence remains persistently negative, thus weighing on a broader spending recovery, with the main property market indicators also remaining sluggish. While new US tariffs are estimated to have a rather modest adverse impact on GDP growth, a further escalation of the US-China conflict implies downside risks, even though additional fiscal stimulus, which had already been signalled by Chinese authorities in December 2024, could mitigate this impact. Meanwhile, Chinese CPI inflation rose to 0.5% in January, while PPI inflation remained in negative territory at -2.3%. Core CPI inflation (excluding food and energy) increased slightly to 0.6% in January from 0.4% the previous month, mainly on account of a temporary increase in services prices following a pick-up in activity helped by increased fiscal support for consumption. Overall, sluggish domestic demand and overproduction are fuelling strong price competition among firms, implying subdued inflationary pressures over the medium term. The outlook for China is deteriorating, as domestic demand remains weak and exports are being hit by higher US tariffs.
Real GDP grew modestly (0.1% quarter-on-quarter) in the fourth quarter of 2024, as private demand and net trade made negative contributions, which were partially offset by the positive impact from inventories and higher government spending. Weak short-term indicators for private demand suggest that subdued growth might continue into 2025. Headline CPI inflation rose to 3.0% in January 2025 from 2.5% in December 2024, driven mainly by food inflation. Headline CPI inflation is expected to remain elevated throughout 2025, supported by increases in energy prices and regulated price changes, as well as the impact of government policies announced in the Autumn Budget 2024 (e.g. an increase in the rate of employer National Insurance contributions). The Bank of England lowered the key policy rate by 25 basis points in its February meeting, judging that domestic price pressures remained stable and that the recent pick-up in headline CPI inflation will not lead to additional second-round effects on underlying domestic inflationary pressures. Activity in the United Kingdom remains modest amid persistent inflation.

This means that output rose in all quarters of the year. As a result, GDP is estimated to have risen by 0.7% in 2024, which represents an improvement vis-à-vis 2023, when it grew by 0.4%. Short-term indicators and available country data point to positive contributions from private consumption and investment, offset by falling net exports, while the contribution from changes in inventories was broadly neutral. At the same time, the industrial sector likely remained weak, while the services sector was more resilient. The fourth quarter outcome for the euro area generates a positive carry-over effect to annual growth in 2025. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, real GDP edged up by 0.1%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2024 (Chart 3).
NA NA
Uncertainty surrounding economic policy – including trade policy – is weighing on the near-term outlook. The predominant source of uncertainty on the global stage relates to US policies, particularly in the security and trade domains. Increasing protectionism might disproportionately affect the manufacturing sector compared with other parts of the economy. Nonetheless, the composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 50.2 on average in January and February (from 49.3 in the fourth quarter), largely on the back of an increase in manufacturing. Despite this recent improvement, the manufacturing PMI still points to contracting activity, with the index having now been below 50 for almost two years (Chart 4). The PMI for new orders has also improved recently but still remains below 50, pointing to a weak short-term outlook for industry. In the services sector, the PMI remains above the no-growth threshold – although the latest readings have been below its long-term average. The European Commission’s business confidence indicators portray a broadly similar picture. Survey data point to continued moderate services sector-led growth in the first quarter of 2025 amid elevated uncertainty.
NA NA
This was lower than in the other quarters of the year (Chart 5). Yet employment growth was resilient in relation to GDP growth, leading to a decline in productivity of 0.1%. The unemployment rate stood at 6.3% in December, 0.1 percentage points higher than in November, remaining close to its lowest level since the euro was introduced. Labour demand has declined somewhat from the high levels seen after the pandemic, with the job vacancy rate unchanged at 2.5% in the fourth quarter, 0.8 percentage points lower than its peak in the second quarter of 2022. Employment increased by 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2024.
NA NA
The monthly composite PMI employment indicator declined from 49.7 in January to 49.3 in February, suggesting that employment in the first quarter is likely to be broadly unchanged compared with the fourth quarter of 2024. The PMI employment indicator for services declined from 50.9 in January to 50.8 in February, while the PMI employment indicators for manufacturing and construction remained in contractionary territory. Short-term labour market indicators point to stable employment in the first quarter of 2025.
After increasing by 0.7%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter (Chart 6), private consumption growth seems to have moderated in the fourth quarter of 2024 – also reflecting the unwinding of some temporary factors that supported its expansion in the previous quarter, e.g. the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. This is corroborated by the 0.4% quarter-on-quarter increase in retail sales and the 0.5% quarter-on-quarter rise in services production. Incoming data point to moderating momentum in household spending growth in the short term as well, as reflected in the latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections. The European Commission’s consumer confidence indicator edged up further in February but remains subdued overall, amid still high uncertainty. The European Commission’s indicators of business expectations for demand in contact-intensive services declined further in February, while the ECB’s latest Consumer Expectations Survey indicates that expected holiday purchases remain robust, despite some recent softening. At the same time, consumer expectations for major purchases in the next 12 months edged up in February, after deteriorating in the previous month. Going forward, persisting economic policy uncertainty, particularly in the context of global economic developments, should continue to weigh on households’ spending decisions. However, higher purchasing power – reflecting the slowdown in inflation – and continued rises in real labour income are expected to support consumption in the quarters ahead. Private consumption growth likely moderated in the fourth quarter of 2024.
NA NA
Following the marked contraction in the third quarter of 2024, business investment (proxied in the national accounts by non-construction investment excluding Irish intangibles) is expected to have increased slightly in the fourth quarter. However, investment in tangible assets has been particularly weak over recent quarters. In the capital goods sector, industrial production fell by 1.2%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter – as anticipated by the PMI output indicators diving deep into negative territory over the course of last year and the industrial confidence indicator at levels last seen during the 2020 lockdown (Chart 7, panel a). Intangible investment continues to grow, although well below the rates seen in the United States (see ). Incoming data suggest weakness at the start of 2025 against a backdrop of elevated uncertainty surrounding geopolitical and economic policy as well as trade policy uncertainty. The latest Corporate Telephone Survey, the Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises in the euro area and the Bank Lending Survey all anticipate subdued investment at the start of the year, with the latter expecting a further downtick in demand in the first quarter for the longer-term loans typically associated with fixed investment. These factors combined are likely to weigh on investment at the start of the year. Further ahead, barring strong disruptions to trade, the gradual pick-up in the wider economy, easing financing conditions and the resolution of some sources of uncertainty should support investment. In addition, ongoing deployments of Next Generation EU funds will help to further crowd in business investment. Business investment likely remained muted around the turn of the year amid high uncertainty.
NA NA
After declining significantly from 2022 onwards, housing investment seems to have bottomed out in the fourth quarter of 2024, as available country data suggest a slight increase in housing investment in the fourth quarter, while production in building and specialised construction remained unchanged compared with the third quarter. Survey-based activity indicators improved at the beginning of this year. Yet overall they continue to point to muted momentum in housing investment in the first quarter of 2025, with both the PMI indicator for housing production and the European Commission’s indicator for building and specialised construction activity in the last three months remaining in contractionary territory (Chart 7, panel b). However, housing investment should gradually gain momentum as 2025 progresses. According to the European Commission’s survey, households’ short-term intentions to buy or build a house increased further in the first quarter. This improvement in sentiment is supported by falling mortgage rates and reflects a gradual recovery in housing loans, suggesting that housing demand is slowly increasing. Housing investment remained largely stable in the fourth quarter of 2024.
Total extra-euro area exports contracted by 0.1%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter. This decline confirms the persisting competitiveness challenges faced by euro area exporters (see ), even amid a recovery in global demand. Looking ahead, surveys suggest that the performance of exports will continue to be subdued in the near term. The latest PMIs for new export orders remained well below the expansion threshold in February for both manufacturing and services. At the same time, monthly goods’ trade data suggest that quarterly import growth slowed in the fourth quarter, suggesting an overall negative contribution of net exports to GDP. Euro area exports declined at a slower pace in the fourth quarter of 2024.
According to the March 2025 ECB staff projections, the economy is expected to grow by 0.9% in 2025, 1.2% in 2026 and 1.3% in 2027. The downward revisions for 2025 and 2026 reflect lower exports and ongoing weakness in investment, in part originating from high trade policy uncertainty as well as broader policy uncertainty. Rising real incomes and the gradually fading effects of the past rate hikes remain the key drivers underpinning the expected pick-up in demand over time. In the March 2025 projections the economic recovery is expected to be slower than anticipated in the December 2024 projections, while uncertainty has increased.

This was primarily attributable to an expected decline in energy inflation, which fell to 0.2% in February from 1.9% in January, owing mainly to a downward base effect and a month-on-month decline in energy prices. By contrast, food inflation stood at 2.7% in February, up from 2.3% in January, reflecting a higher annual rate for unprocessed food prices, while the rate for processed food prices was unchanged. The HICPX edged down to 2.6% in February from 2.7% in January – the first decline since September 2024. This reflected lower services inflation (at 3.7% in February, down from 3.9% in January) and concealed a small increase in NEIG inflation (0.6% in February, up from 0.5% in January). The decline in services inflation in February is in line with earlier expectations of both an initial moderation driven by gradually easing wage growth and weaker repricing effects in early 2025 than in 2024. Euro area headline inflation, as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), decreased to 2.4% in February from 2.5% in January (Chart 8).
NA NA
In January 2025 – the latest month for which data are available – the bulk of the indicator values ranged from 2.1% to 2.8%. The Persistent and Common Component of Inflation (PCCI), which tends to perform best as a predictor of future headline inflation, was still at the bottom of this range, while the weighted median indicator increased to 2.8%. HICPX inflation excluding travel-related items, clothing and footwear (HICPXX) was unchanged at 2.6%, whereas the Supercore indicator, which comprises HICP items that are sensitive to the business cycle, decreased to 2.7%. Although the indicator for domestic inflation remained at a persistently high level, it edged down to 4.0% in January, from 4.2% in December 2024. This was the first time it had declined since October 2024. The change was due mainly to lower contributions from restaurant and cafe prices, as well as from insurance costs in the health and transport sectors. Most measures of underlying inflation are consistent with expectations that inflation will settle at around the 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis (Chart 9).
NA NA
At the early stages of the pricing chain, producer price inflation for energy, which had been negative since April 2023, turned positive, rising to 3.5% in January 2025 from ‑1.6% in December 2024. The annual growth rate of producer prices for domestic sales of intermediate goods increased (to 0.5% in January, up from 0.0% in December). At the later stages of the pricing chain, domestic producer price inflation for non-food consumer goods increased to 1.6% in January, from 1.2% in December, while producer prices for the manufacturing of food products decreased slightly to 1.4% in January, from 1.5% in December. The latest available data for import prices at the cut-off date for this report refer to December 2024. For intermediate goods, the annual growth rate of import prices had continued to rise (to 1.5% in December, up from 0.9% in November). Meanwhile, import price inflation for the manufacturing of food products had increased to 8.2% in December, possibly driven by the double-digit growth rates of international food commodity prices. The growth in import price inflation also reflects the depreciation of the euro. Overall, the latest data on producer and import prices confirm that the gradual easing of accumulated pipeline pressures on consumer goods has been fading out but has not resulted in a noticeable reacceleration. Most indicators of pipeline pressures for goods increased but at still moderate rates (Chart 10).
NA NA
The latest available national account data for domestic cost pressures for the euro area continue to refer to the third quarter of 2024. The annual growth rate of the GDP deflator declined to 2.7%, from 2.9% in the previous quarter, reflecting a smaller contribution from wages and unit labour costs. Unit profit growth remained in negative territory, indicating that it is continuing to buffer still elevated labour cost pressures. Available data from national accounts for most of the euro area countries suggested that the moderating labour cost growth and profit buffering continued in the fourth quarter. Moreover, other indicators available for the euro area in the fourth quarter, such as the labour cost index and the negotiated wage indicator, confirm the further easing of labour cost pressures. Growth in the hourly wages and salary component of the labour cost index declined to 4.1%, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, from 4.4% in the third quarter. Growth in the negotiated wage indicator stood at 4.1% in the fourth quarter, down from 5.4% in the third quarter. Moreover, the ECB’s forward-looking wage tracker, which includes data on negotiated wage agreements up to mid-February, keeps pointing to easing wage growth pressures at the beginning of this year. Looking forward, the March 2025 ECB staff macroeconomic projections expect growth in compensation per employee to stand at 3.4% on average for 2025 and to continue moderating to 2.6% in 2027. Domestic cost pressures, as measured by growth in the GDP deflator, fell further in the third quarter of 2024, although these remained elevated (Chart 11).
NA NA
In both the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters for the first quarter of 2025 and the ECB Survey of Monetary Analysts for March 2025, average and median longer-term inflation expectations remained at 2%. Shorter-term survey expectations for 2025 also stood at around 2% but saw small changes depending on the incorporation of the latest data outcomes and movements in energy commodity prices. Market-based measures of short-term inflation compensation, as measured by the one year forward inflation-linked swap rate one year ahead, have recently edged up and stand at around 1.8%. Looking at the medium and longer term, market-based measures of inflation compensation have also increased. Notably, the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead stands at around 2.2%, having increased by about 20 basis points since the December Governing Council meeting, largely reflecting movements following the recently announced plans for fiscal budget expansion in Europe. This rise is mostly attributed to higher inflation risk premia. Consequently, model-based estimates of genuine inflation expectations, excluding inflation risk premia, indicate that market participants continue to expect inflation to be around 2% in the longer term. On the consumer side, inflation expectations mostly resumed their downward momentum. According to the ECB Consumer Expectations Survey for January 2025, median expectations for headline inflation over the next 12 months decreased to 2.6%, from 2.8% in December 2024, while expectations for three years ahead remained unchanged at 2.4%. Median inflation perceptions over the previous 12 months declined slightly to 3.4% in January. There was little change in survey-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations, while market-based measures of medium to longer-term inflation compensation increased slightly, with most standing at around 2% (Chart 12).
NA NA
Headline inflation is projected to remain relatively stable in 2025, owing mainly to higher food inflation and base effects in energy prices, which broadly offset lower core inflation. It is then expected to gradually ease further in early 2026 as the base effects in energy inflation fade away. The projected increase in headline inflation in 2027 mainly reflects a temporary upward impact from energy inflation, owing to fiscal measures related to the climate change transition, in particular the introduction of a new Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS2). Compared with the December 2024 projections, the outlook for headline inflation has been revised up by 0.2 percentage points for 2025, is unrevised for 2026 and has been revised down by 0.1 percentage points for 2027. The upward revision for 2025 is mainly owing to upward data surprises for energy inflation and higher oil and electricity price assumptions. HICPX inflation is expected to decline from 2.8% in 2024 to 2.2% in 2025,2.0% in 2026 and 1.9% in 2027, primarily driven by a decrease in services inflation. Compared with the December 2024 projections, HICPX inflation has been revised down by 0.1 percentage points for 2025 and has been revised up by 0.1 percentage points for 2026. The March 2025 ECB staff macroeconomic projections expect headline inflation to average 2.3% in 2025 and to decline to 1.9% in 2026 and 2.0% in 2027 (Chart 13).

4 Financial market developments NA
, NA
The benchmark €STR averaged 2.8% over the review period, following the Governing Council’s widely anticipated decisions to lower the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points at both its December and January meetings. Excess liquidity decreased by around €75 billion to €2,826 billion. This mainly reflected the repayments in December of funds borrowed in the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations and the decline in the portfolios of securities held for monetary policy purposes, with the Eurosystem no longer reinvesting the principal payments from maturing securities. The short end of the €STR-based OIS forward curve repriced upwards during the review period, pointing to a higher path for policy rates, with significant intermittent fluctuations. Following the December Governing Council meeting, short-term interest rates rose across major advanced economies amid concerns that US disinflation was progressing more slowly than expected. After peaking in mid-January, the euro area curve retracted as market participants anticipated a continuation of domestic disinflation and a weakening growth outlook, with the latter partly attributable to heightening trade uncertainty. However, in the run-up to the March Governing Council meeting, the euro area curve rebounded against the backdrop of defence and infrastructure spending plans in European countries. At the end of the review period, the forward curve fully priced in a rate cut of 25 basis points at the March Governing Council meeting and around 65 basis points of cumulative cuts by the end of 2025. Since the December Governing Council meeting, the OIS forward curve has repriced upwards
NA NA
By the end of the review period, the ten-year euro area OIS rate had risen by around 45 basis points to approximately 2.5%, despite significant fluctuations throughout the period. The ten-year OIS rate climbed by around 40 basis points from the start of the review period up to mid-January on account of strong upward pressures originating from the United States. However, it subsequently retracted as market participants shifted their focus to the euro area outlook for inflation and the real economy. Finally, at the end of the review period, a ramp-up in fiscal spending plans in Europe caused long-term risk-free rates to increase by around 25 basis points. In the United States, long-term risk-free rates initially rose by around 45 basis points to reach their peak in mid-January, before falling from mid-February onwards. This retraction, which has recently been cemented by signs that US economic growth may be slowing, brought US rates down to around 4.3%, slightly below their levels at the beginning of the review period. As a result, the differential between ten-year risk-free rates in the euro area and the United States narrowed by 49 basis points. The ten-year UK sovereign bond yield increased by 31 basis points to stand at around 4.7% at the end of the review period. Euro area long-term risk-free rates fluctuated over the review period and increased overall (Chart 15).
NA NA
The ten-year GDP-weighted euro area sovereign bond yield closed the review period at around 3.2%, approximately 55 basis points higher than its level at the start of the period. This increase led to a widening of around 10 basis points in the spread over the €STR-based OIS rate. French sovereign bond yields performed similarly to the GDP-weighted euro area sovereign bond yield in spite of a recent perceived improvement in the country’s political situation following the French Parliament’s approval of the 2025 budget. The German sovereign bond spread widened by 16 basis points, remaining firmly in positive territory. Sovereign bond spreads also increased in other euro area countries, with Spanish and Portuguese sovereign bond spreads widening by 16 and 24 basis points respectively. Long-term euro area sovereign bond yields generally tracked movements in risk-free rates, with some yield spreads widening (Chart 16).
NA NA
Over the review period, equity prices in the euro area climbed by 10.1% overall. Bank equity prices outperformed those of non-financial corporations (NFCs), with increases of 28.8% and 7.5% being recorded respectively. Euro area equity prices were supported by an ongoing healthy earnings season and by recently announced plans for fiscal budget expansion in Europe. Firms in the financial and industrial sectors reported particularly strong earnings relative to expectations and, consequently, they recorded some of the largest equity price gains. In the United States, the broad equity price index fell by 3.8% amid some recent concerns surrounding the US economic outlook and a decrease in IT-sector stock valuations as a result of perceived considerable advances in artificial intelligence in China. Notably, the equity prices of US NFCs declined by 4.4%, whereas those of banks fell by 1.2%. Euro area equity prices strengthened, propelled by a healthy earnings season despite the weak macroeconomic outlook and rising trade uncertainty (Chart 17).
NA NA
The healthy earnings season was also reflected in corporate bond spreads, which declined in both the investment-grade and high-yield segments amid some volatility. Spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds narrowed by around 15 basis points, with spreads on bonds issued by financial corporations decreasing by less than those on non-financial corporate bonds. There was a more pronounced tightening of around 30 basis points in the high-yield segment, reflecting reductions in non-financial and financial corporate bond spreads of around 35 and 20 basis points respectively. Corporate bond spreads narrowed for high-yield and investment-grade firms, following movements in stock markets.
During the review period, the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro – as measured against the currencies of 41 of the euro area’s most important trading partners – strengthened by 1%. The euro appreciated by a significant 1.9% against the US dollar, following updates relating to Europe’s fiscal stance towards the end of the review period. The euro was also supported – albeit more modestly – by an overall increase in global risk appetite despite tariff announcements and some concerns over the US macroeconomic outlook, which were reflected in a decline in the interest rate differential between the United States and the euro area. The appreciation of the euro was fairly broad-based across currencies, significant fluctuations notwithstanding. Among the euro area’s largest trading partners, the euro appreciated against the pound sterling, the Indian rupee and the Turkish lira (by 1.3%, 4.5% and 6.5% respectively). It depreciated against the Polish zloty (by 2.9%), reflecting market participants’ expectations of a relatively tighter monetary policy stance in Poland, and against the Swedish krona (by 4.2%), partly on the back of narrowing expected interest rate differentials. The euro was broadly stable against the Japanese yen (+0.3%), as the impact of the Bank of Japan’s tighter monetary policy stance during the review period was offset by the increase in bond yields in the euro area. In foreign exchange markets, the euro appreciated in trade-weighted terms and strengthened to a greater extent against the US dollar (Chart 18).

5 Financing conditions and credit developments NA
In January 2025 bank funding costs remained broadly unchanged at high levels, while bank lending rates continued their gradual decline from peak levels. The average interest rates on new loans to firms and on new mortgages fell in January to 4.2% and 3.3% respectively. Growth in loans to firms and households increased in January but remained weak and well below its historical average, reflecting still subdued demand and tight credit standards. Over the period from 12 December 2024 to 5 March 2025, the cost to firms of both equity and market-based debt financing increased owing to the higher long-term risk-free interest rate. The annual growth rate of broad money (M3) strengthened slightly to 3.6% in January. NA
The composite cost of debt financing for euro area banks saw relatively little change in January (Chart 19, panel a). The upward pressure on bank funding costs resulted primarily from higher bank bond yields (Chart 19, panel b), driven by shifts in the long-term risk-free rate, as indicated by data available until 5 March. Average deposit rates remained fairly stable, with the composite deposit rate standing at 1.2% in January. While interest rates on time deposits for firms and households declined further, rates on overnight deposits and deposits redeemable at notice were unchanged overall. Euro area bank funding costs remained broadly unchanged in January 2025, despite past policy rate cuts.
NA NA
Lending rates for firms and households have fallen since the summer of 2024, reflecting lower policy rates (Chart 20). In January 2025 lending rates for new loans to non-financial corporations (NFCs) fell by 12 basis points to stand at 4.24%, around 1 percentage point below their October 2023 peak (Chart 20, panel a). This fall was widespread across the largest euro area countries and concentrated in loans with maturities of up to five years. In contrast, rates on loans with maturities of more than five years increased by 11 basis points, reflecting the rise in longer-term risk-free rates. For firms, the cost of issuing market-based debt rose to 3.7% in January, 0.2 percentage points above its December level. The spread between interest rates on small and large loans to firms narrowed in January to 0.31 percentage points, close to its historical low, amid cross-country heterogeneity. Lending rates on new loans to households for house purchase edged down by 14 basis points to stand at 3.25% in November, around 80 basis points below their November 2023 peak (Chart 20, panel b), with variation across countries. The decline was driven solely by lower rates on renegotiated loans, while the rates on new loans excluding renegotiations were broadly unchanged. Bank lending rates for firms and for households declined further.
NA NA
Based on the monthly data available until January 2025, the overall cost of financing for NFCs – i.e. the composite cost of bank borrowing, market-based debt and equity – declined in January compared with the previous month and stood at 5.6%, below the multi-year high reached in October 2023 (Chart 21). Daily data covering the period from 12 December 2024 to 5 March 2025 show that the cost of market-based debt financing increased, driven by an upward shift in the overnight index swap (OIS) curve at the medium and long-term maturities that was only partially counterbalanced by a compression of corporate bond spreads associated with a healthy earnings season (see Section 4) that was more sizeable in the high-yield segment. The cost of equity financing rose as a result of the strengthening of the equity risk premium and – more notably – the higher long-term risk-free rate, as approximated by the ten-year OIS rate. Over the period from 12 December 2024 to 5 March 2025, the cost to firms of both equity and market-based debt financing rose.
NA NA
The annual growth rate of bank lending to firms rose to 2.0% in January 2025, amid volatile monthly flows, up from 1.7% in December 2024 but well below its historical average of 4.8% (Chart 22, panel a). The increase occurred despite a relatively weak monthly flow in January and was primarily attributable to base effects, given that the negative flow of January 2024 ceased to be included in the annual figure. Growth in debt securities issued by firms rose to 3.4% in annual terms. The annual growth rate of loans to households continued its steady recovery. It edged up to 1.3% in January from 1.1% in December, although it remained well below its historical average of 4.1% (Chart 22, panel b). Mortgages were still the primary driving force behind this upward trend, although consumer credit continued to strengthen, with its annual growth rising to 4.0% in January. By contrast, other lending to households, including loans to sole proprietors, was again weak. The ECB’s  in January showed that the percentage of households who perceived credit access to have been tighter still outweighs that perceiving credit access to have been easier. Growth in loans to firms and households increased in January but remained weak and well below its historical average, reflecting still subdued demand and tight credit standards.
NA NA
Annual M3 growth stood at 3.6% in January 2025, up from 3.4% in December 2024 but down from 3.8% in November (Chart 23). Annual growth of narrow money (M1) – which comprises the most liquid assets of M3 – increased to 2.7% in January, compared with 1.8% in December. The increase was driven by the sharp surge in the annual growth rate of overnight deposits, which rose to 2.9% in January, up from 1.8% in December, reflecting investors’ heightened preference for liquidity. The composition of money creation continued to shift. While the contribution of net foreign flows weakened further, bank net purchases of government securities picked up in January and the contribution of lending to firms and households gained weight, despite remaining subdued. At the same time, the ongoing contraction of the Eurosystem balance sheet and the increase in the issuance of long-term bank bonds (which are not included in M3) continued to contribute negatively to M3 growth. Broad money (M3) growth remained relatively stable in January, supported by bank purchases of government securities, while net foreign inflows continued to weaken.
NA NA
6 Fiscal developments NA
NA NA
The euro area budget deficit is estimated to have declined from 3.6% in 2023 to 3.2% of GDP in 2024, as a result of a combination of sizeable non-discretionary factors and the withdrawal of most of the energy and inflation support measures that were previously in place. The deficit should be unchanged at 3.2% in 2025 and remain broadly the same in the two following years as well, standing at 3.3% in both 2026 and 2027. The relatively stable outlook reflects a slow improvement in cyclically adjusted primary balances which is broadly offset by a gradual increase in interest expenditures. This increase reflects the pass-through of past interest rate rises, albeit proceeding at a slow pace given the long residual maturities of outstanding sovereign debt. Compared with the December 2024 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the budget balance has been revised down very marginally for 2025 and more significantly by the end of the projection horizon (by 0.4 percentage points in 2027). These revisions primarily reflect a worsening of the macroeconomic outlook but also some fiscal loosening in discretionary fiscal measures. According to the March 2025 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the euro area general government budget deficit should be unchanged at 3.2% of GDP in 2025 and remain broadly the same until 2027 (Chart 24).
NA NA
The estimated annual change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, adjusted for grants extended to countries under the NGEU programme, shows a significant tightening (0.9 percentage points of GDP) of fiscal policies in the euro area in 2024. This mostly reflects the phasing-out of a large part of government energy and inflation-related support measures, as well as sizeable non-discretionary factors reflecting strong revenue developments in some countries. A tightening of 0.2 percentage points is expected in 2025, mainly due to higher taxes, which is partly offset by a negative contribution from non-discretionary factors. While the fiscal stance is expected to remain broadly neutral in 2026, it should tighten significantly − by 0.5 percentage points of GDP − in 2027 when the NGEU programme expires. As a result, the cumulative tightening of the fiscal stance over the 2024-27 projection horizon amounts to 1.6 percentage points of GDP. The euro area fiscal stance tightened significantly in 2024 and is expected to tighten somewhat in 2025 and significantly again in 2027.
The debt ratio increased significantly during the pandemic, to around 97% in 2020, before falling gradually as of 2021. According to the March 2025 projections, however, this improvement has reversed, and the debt ratio is expected to increase gradually from around 87% of GDP in 2023 to about 90% of GDP in 2027. The increase over the projection horizon is driven by continued primary deficits and expected positive deficit-debt adjustments that are only partly compensated by favourable (negative) interest rate-growth differentials. The euro area debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase slowly throughout the projection horizon from an already elevated level (Chart 25).
NA NA
Four euro area countries (Belgium, Germany, Lithuania and Austria) have not yet submitted their plans. With regard to excessive deficit procedures, the ECOFIN Council has adopted recommendations under Article 126(7) of the  (TFEU) which specify the pathways and deadlines for correcting excessive deficits. Italy and Hungary have been asked to bring their government deficits to below 3% of GDP by 2026, Belgium, Malta and Slovakia by 2027, Poland by 2028, France by 2029 and Romania by 2030. The recommendations set a deadline of 30 April 2025 for each of the countries to take effective action and present the necessary measures to put an end to the excessive deficit situations. On 21 January 2025 the EU’s Economics and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN Council) endorsed recommendations on the first set of national medium-term fiscal structural plans.
The first proposal entails unleashing public funding for defence at the national level by activating the national escape clause of the Stability and Growth Pact, provided that fiscal sustainability is maintained. This would allow Member States to raise their expenditure on defence, by 1.5% of GDP for example, without triggering an excessive deficit procedure, and thereby to act swiftly, as needed in the current situation. According to the Commission’s assessment, this would amount to additional spending of up to €650 billion over the period 2025-28. The second proposal is for a new instrument that would provide €150 billion of loans to Member States for defence investment to enhance pan-European defence capabilities. The third proposal is based on using the EU budget to direct funds towards defence-related investments. Finally, the last two areas of action aim at mobilising private capital by accelerating the Savings and Investment Union and through the European Investment Bank. On 4 March the European Commission announced the ReArm Europe plan, outlining a set of five proposals on how available financial levers can be used to help Member States to quickly and significantly increase expenditures in defence capabilities.

1 Business investment: why is the euro area lagging behind the United States? NA
NA NA
In the post-pandemic period between the fourth quarter of 2021 and the fourth quarter of 2024, business investment grew by 15.4% in the United States – more than double the 6.8% cumulative increase over this period in the euro area (Chart A). Across components, intangible investment – i.e. intellectual property products (IPP) – has contributed most to the differential, with euro area growth in intangibles (excluding volatile Irish IPP) only half that in the United States. In terms of the other main asset classes, transport equipment contributed only slightly less to investment in the euro area than in the United States. At the same time machinery and equipment investment declined in the euro area, while remaining slightly positive in the United States. Business investment in the euro area has grown less dynamically – and its outlook remains less favourable – than in the United States.

2 Have euro area exports missed the tech train? NA
NA NA
The share of euro area firms in global goods exports has fallen by about 2 percentage points since 2019. The weakness of euro area export growth is a sign of lower productivity gains of European firms compared to other major economies. While there are a number of factors behind the euro area’s competitiveness challenges, the Draghi report pointed to Europe’s lack of competitiveness in high-tech sectors as one key factor in the euro area’s subdued economic performance. This box assesses the sectoral composition of the euro area’s recent performance in global markets by categorising exports according to the intensity of their technological content, as reflected in the level of research and development expenditure relative to value added. This helps in identifying the sectoral drivers of the losses in market share. Specifically, the box examines whether aggregate euro area export market share losses reflect a limited presence in fast-growing high-tech sectors or a deteriorating performance in established sectors. Euro area export market shares have declined since the pandemic.

3 The increasing energy demand of artificial intelligence and its impact on commodity prices NA
NA NA
AI-related energy consumption in data centres is currently limited, estimated at around 20 terawatt-hours (TWh) or 0.02% of global energy consumption. However, AI models are increasingly being used to develop intelligent applications, ranging from AI assistants to self-driving vehicles. Generative AI models, particularly those used for creating text and image-based content, require large amounts of power in terms of both training and operation. For example, a single query on ChatGPT3 uses roughly ten times more energy than a typical Google search. With the development of newer and more computationally intensive large language models (LLMs), the related energy demand is expected to grow further. The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) models has surged across the globe, requiring substantial computing power.

Rents are a large component of household spending, but their analysis has been somewhat challenging as harmonised data on households’ rent expenditure are not readily available across the euro area. The CES can contribute to filling this data gap as it collects timely information about household spending. It also allows for the analysis of heterogeneity across the countries covered by the CES, as well as individual households. This box analyses recent developments in the euro area rental market using data from the ECB Consumer Expectations Survey (CES).

6 Understanding the relative development of goods and services inflation NA
NA NA
Historically, services prices have increased at faster rates than NEIG prices, implying a persistent positive gap between the two inflation rates. The gap in annual inflation rates changed from an average of 1.5 percentage points in the period from 1999 to 2008 to an average of 1.0 percentage points between 2008 and 2019. This narrowing was mainly due to a decrease in services inflation, probably reflecting subdued demand and low wage growth after the financial and sovereign debt crises. During the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions such as social distancing and widespread lockdown measures affected the relative consumption of goods and services and associated price pressures.By 2022, the rapid and strong increase in NEIG inflation, which outpaced the increase in services inflation, led to a negative gap of more than 1 percentage point, which only reverted to positive territory when goods inflation normalised in 2023 and 2024 in a way that was almost symmetrical to the previous surge. However, while NEIG inflation came down, services inflation remained elevated and has since hovered around 4%. The positive gap has thus widened to an average of 2.5 percentage points in recent quarters. The gap between services and non-energy industrial goods (NEIG) inflation varies over time, but it had remained positive for a long period until the 2021-2022 inflation surge (Chart A).

7 Insights from banks and firms on euro area credit conditions: a comparison based on ECB surveys NA
NA NA
The  (BLS) and the  (SAFE) are long-standing surveys that provide qualitative information on credit supply and demand and interaction between them. Both surveys offer important early indications of future trends in loan volumes and provide information on factors driving loan supply and demand. The BLS focuses on bank lending conditions, including their interactions with alternative sources of financing, as assessed by banks. The SAFE provides more detailed insights, based on the answers of firms, into the broader capital structure of firms. By combining findings from both the BLS and the SAFE, the surveys complement hard data on lending volumes and interest rates and enhance the interpretation of financial and economic conditions within the euro area. This box provides a comprehensive assessment of survey data on bank lending to euro area firms from the perspective of banks and firms.

drag on growth even if survey indicators are improving high uncertainty both at home and abroad is holding back investment and competitiveness challenges are weighing on exports at the same time

data suggest that employment growth was subdued in the first two months of na persistently high geopolitical and policy uncertainty is expected to weigh on euro area economic growth especially in investment and exports slowing down the anticipated recovery this follows slightly weaker than expected growth at the end of both domestic and trade policy uncertainty are high although the baseline projection only includes the impact of new tariffs on trade between the united states and china the negative effects of uncertainty regarding the possibility of further changes in global trade policies particularly vis à vis the european union are assumed to weigh on euro area exports and investment this coupled with persistent competitiveness challenges is assessed to lead to a further decline in the euro area s export market share despite these headwinds the conditions remain in place for euro area gdp growth to strengthen again over the projection horizon rising real wages and employment in the context of a strong albeit cooling labour market are expected to support a recovery in which consumption remains a key contributor to growth domestic demand should also be supported by an easing of financing conditions as implied by market expectations about the future path of interest rates the labour market should remain resilient with the unemployment rate expected to average in edging down to in as some of the cyclical factors that have recently reduced productivity start to unwind productivity is expected to pick up over the projection horizon although structural challenges remain overall annual average real gdp growth is expected to be in and to strengthen to in and to in compared with the december eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area the outlook for gdp growth has been revised down by percentage points for both and but is unchanged for the weaker outlook is mainly due to downward revisions to exports and to a lesser extent to investment reflecting a stronger impact of uncertainty than previously assumed as well as expectations that competitiveness challenges will likely persist for longer than had been anticipated na fiscal and structural policies should make the economy more productive competitive and resilient the european commission s competitiveness compass provides a concrete roadmap for action and its proposals should be swiftly adopted governments should ensure sustainable public finances in line with the eu s economic governance framework and prioritise essential growth enhancing structural reforms and strategic investment na inflation na according to eurostat s flash estimate annual inflation stood at in february after in january and in december energy price inflation slowed to following a strong increase to in january from in december by contrast food price inflation rose to from in january and in december goods inflation ticked up to while services inflation eased to from in january and in december na most indicators of underlying inflation are pointing to a sustained return of inflation to the governing council s medium term target domestic inflation which closely tracks services inflation declined in january but it remains high as wages and some services prices are still adjusting to the past inflation surge with a substantial delay at the same time recent wage negotiations point to a continued moderation in labour cost pressures na headline hicp inflation has increased over recent months but is projected to moderate marginally in the course of and then to decline and hover around the governing council s inflation target of from the first quarter of at the start of the projection horizon upward base effects in the energy component and higher food price inflation are expected to broadly offset downward impacts from a decline in hicp inflation excluding energy and food hicpx the rise in energy commodity prices at the turn of the year will carry over into the annual rate of change in energy prices in although oil and gas prices are assumed to decline in line with futures prices energy inflation is likely to continue to record positive rates albeit below the historical average over the entire projection horizon in energy inflation is seen to be driven up by the introduction of new climate change mitigation measures food inflation is projected to rise until mid mainly driven by recent robust increases in food commodity prices before declining to stand at an average of in hicpx inflation is expected to start to decline in early as the effects of lagged repricing fade wage pressures recede and the impact from past monetary policy tightening continues to feed through to consumer prices the decline in hicpx inflation is expected to be mainly driven by a decrease in services inflation which has thus far been relatively persistent overall hicpx inflation is projected to moderate from in to in wage growth should continue to follow a downward path from the current still elevated levels as inflation compensation pressures fade coupled with the anticipated recovery in productivity growth this is expected to lead to significantly slower growth in unit labour costs as a result domestic price pressures are projected to continue to ease with profit margins recovering over the projection horizon external price pressures as reflected in import prices are expected to remain moderate assuming that eu trade tariff policies remain unchanged compared with the december projections the outlook for headline hicp inflation has been revised up by percentage points for on account of higher energy commodity price assumptions and the depreciation of the euro while it has been marginally revised down for owing to a slightly weaker outlook for the energy component at the end of the horizon na in summary the assumption of higher energy price inflation led staff to revise up the headline inflation projection for at the same time staff expect core inflation to continue slowing as labour cost pressures ease further and the past monetary policy tightening continues to weigh on prices most measures of longer term inflation expectations continue to stand at around all of these factors will support the sustainable return of inflation to the governing council s target na risk assessment na the risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside an escalation in trade tensions would lower euro area growth by dampening exports and weakening the global economy ongoing uncertainty about global trade policies could drag investment down geopolitical tensions such as russia s unjustified war against ukraine and the tragic conflict in the middle east remain a major source of uncertainty as well growth could be lower if the lagged effects of monetary policy tightening last longer than expected at the same time growth could be higher if easier financing conditions and falling inflation allow domestic consumption and investment to rebound faster an increase in defence and infrastructure spending could also add to growth na increasing friction in global trade is adding more uncertainty to the outlook for euro area inflation a general escalation in trade tensions could see the euro depreciate and import costs rise which would put upward pressure on inflation at the same time lower demand for euro area exports as a result of higher tariffs and a re routing of exports into the euro area from countries with overcapacity would put downward pressure on inflation geopolitical tensions create two sided inflation risks as regards energy markets consumer confidence and business investment extreme weather events and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly could drive up food prices by more than expected inflation could turn out higher if wages or profits increase by more than expected a boost in defence and infrastructure spending could also raise inflation through its effect on aggregate demand but inflation might surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampens demand by more than expected na financial and monetary conditions na market interest rates in the euro area decreased after the governing council s meeting on january but rose in the run up to its meeting on march in response to a revised outlook for fiscal policy the interest rate cuts are gradually making it less expensive for firms and households to borrow and loan growth is picking up at the same time a headwind to the easing of financing conditions comes from past interest rate hikes still transmitting to the stock of credit and lending remains subdued overall na the average interest rate on new loans to firms declined to in january from in december by contrast firms cost of issuing market based debt rose to percentage points above its december level over the same period the average interest rate on new mortgages declined to from na growth in bank lending to firms rose to in january up from in december on the back of a moderate monthly flow of new loans growth in debt securities issued by firms rose to in annual terms mortgage lending continued to rise gradually but remained muted overall with an annual growth rate of na monetary policy decisions na the interest rates on the deposit facility the main refinancing operations and the marginal lending facility were decreased to and respectively with effect from march na the asset purchase programme and pandemic emergency purchase programme portfolios are declining at a measured and predictable pace as the eurosystem no longer reinvests the principal payments from maturing securities na conclusion na at its meeting on march the governing council decided to lower the three key ecb interest rates by basis points in particular the decision to lower the deposit facility rate the rate through which the governing council steers the monetary policy stance is based on its updated assessment of the inflation outlook the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission the governing council is determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at its medium term target especially in current conditions of rising uncertainty it will follow a data dependent and meeting by meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance in particular the governing council s interest rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission the governing council is not pre committing to a particular rate path na in any case the governing council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at its medium term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission na external environment na na na although still in expansionary territory the global composite output purchasing managers index pmi excluding the euro area declined in february due to a slowdown in the services sector chart which had been the primary driver of growth in the second half of the drop in services sentiment was broad based across major economies but most pronounced in the united states overall the latest ecb staff nowcasting model for global gdp which incorporates a broad range of macroeconomic indicators in addition to pmis continues to point to steady growth of around quarter on quarter in the first quarter of nevertheless near term growth prospects are clouded by the recent changes to us trade policy which implied not only the imposition of new tariffs on china but also an increase in trade policy uncertainty which is expected to act as a drag on global investment growth in global activity remained steady at the turn of the year but recent shifts in the us trade policy stance may imply stronger headwinds to come na na global real gdp is projected to grow by in before decreasing to in while the precise timing and scope of recent us trade policy announcements are still unclear the march ecb staff macroeconomic projections incorporate the tariffs imposed by the united states on imports from china which came into force on february i e before the projections cut off date of february and retaliatory measures by china compared with the december eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections global growth has been revised down by percentage point for and as the newly imposed tariffs and higher trade policy uncertainty are expected to weigh on activity in the slight decline in global gdp growth reflects slower growth in china amid unfavourable demographic dynamics and in the united states due to the negative medium term impact of us policies e g lower immigration downside risks to the global outlook prevail driven by the threat of more us tariffs e g levies on steel and aluminium as well as tariffs on imports from canada mexico and the european union and prevailing geopolitical tensions the outlook for global activity growth is projected to remain moderate easing slightly over the projection horizon while the mild improvement in manufacturing sentiment and industrial production can support global trade dynamics in the first quarter of growth in global activity at the turn of the year was driven mainly by components with low trade intensity i e public and private consumption in addition elevated trade policy uncertainty and slower monetary policy easing in the united states are expected to weigh on investment in the future affecting trade disproportionately as investment tends to be highly trade intensive moreover the frontloading of trade which supported global trade in as firms in the united states in particular stockpiled imports of foreign inputs ahead of possible trade disruptions is expected to gradually fade in as new tariffs take effect a partial unwinding of the frontloading of imports is also expected to weigh on demand throughout mostly across the advanced economies that frontloaded imports from emerging markets in lastly trade flows are expected to be significantly affected by tariffs over the projection horizon with the march projections entailing large downward revisions to imports and exports in the united states and china by a cumulated percentage points each over against this background growth in euro area foreign demand is projected to moderate from in to in and to in and with significant downward revisions compared with the december projections global trade growth moderated at the end of and is projected to slow amid the impact of tariffs elevated trade policy uncertainty a less favourable composition of demand and an unwinding of the earlier frontloading of imports the outlook for trade is clouded by uncertainty as protectionism could significantly hamper cross border flows us tariffs on canada and mexico would affect around one third of total us imports of goods and around three quarters of total goods exported by canada and mexico with the impact of tariffs likely to be amplified by the interconnected nature of supply chains across north america on february the us administration announced a tariff on steel and aluminium entering the united states effective as of march despite the small share of these goods in us imports us consumers and industries located downstream in supply chains e g the automotive industry are expected to be negatively affected furthermore president trump instructed his advisers to devise a comprehensive plan for reciprocal tariffs on february and announced global tariffs on cars pharmaceuticals and semiconductors on february on february he argued in favour of a review of trade partners tariffs on us digital services announced a tariff on european imports on february and an additional levy on china on february the ongoing escalation of trade tensions poses risks to the smooth functioning of existing trade networks in january the annual rate of consumer price index cpi inflation across oecd members excluding türkiye rose to up from the previous month chart this uptick in headline cpi inflation was partly due to higher energy prices with the contribution of food prices remaining broadly stable core cpi inflation which excludes energy and food prices increased slightly to headline inflation across oecd member countries has increased amid a slight increase in core inflation na na although the disinflation process across oecd members appears to have stalled at the end of cpi inflation across a broader group of advanced and emerging countries in the march projections is expected to decline gradually from in to in the cooling of labour markets across oecd members is expected to drive down nominal wage inflation allowing headline cpi inflation to gradually converge towards central bank targets compared with the december projections headline cpi inflation across a broader group of advanced and emerging countries is expected to be higher in reflecting the pass through of tariffs to consumer prices in the united states and to a lesser extent in china for and cpi inflation across global economies has been revised down as the upward impact of tariffs is more than compensated by other factors mainly downward revisions to cpi inflation in china reflecting entrenched deflation in producer prices amid a lingering oversupply notwithstanding the recent uptick across oecd members cpi inflation across a broader group of advanced and emerging countries is projected to remain on a declining path over the projection horizon concerns about the impact of trade disputes on global activity exerted downward pressure on oil prices which was further reinforced by an unexpected build up in us crude oil inventories indicating weaker than expected demand for oil in the united states european gas prices experienced strong volatility as colder temperatures and a low renewable energy output led initially to higher prices owing to an increase in the amount of gas consumed for heating and to generate power however gas spot prices declined as a result of announcements about ukraine peace negotiations downward price pressures have also been reinforced by milder weather and by lng tankers being redirected towards europe metal prices increased by mainly as a result of us based traders making precautionary purchases following the announcements made on february regarding steel and aluminium tariffs along with threats made on february to impose levies on imported copper lastly food prices declined by as cocoa prices corrected downward slightly after surging in late and early over the review period brent crude oil prices decreased by while european gas prices declined by real gdp growth in the fourth quarter of quarter on quarter was mainly driven by private consumption owing to higher real disposable incomes while business investment fell in the first quarter of the latest ecb staff nowcast for us gdp expects growth to remain robust at quarter on quarter the financial constraints affecting us consumers appear to be growing although the knock on effects on consumption seem limited while credit card defaults have risen to above their pre pandemic averages the number of consumer foreclosures and bankruptcies remains low by historical comparison and the household debt service ratio remains close to pre pandemic levels in addition the largest increase in credit card defaults relates to lower income households who account for only of total consumer spending on the nominal side although the january cpi release was higher than expected it hints at a decline in both headline and core personal consumption expenditures pce inflation in the near term which is also supported by the recent deceleration in the producer price index ppi overall key sources of inflation are cooling in the united states where labour market tightness indicators have steadily declined back to their pre pandemic levels still the inflation outlook remains subject to significant uncertainty and us policies could further slow the gradual disinflation as tariffs on us imports are expected to be passed through to consumer prices while stricter immigration and deportations risk a renewed tightening of the labour market against this backdrop us consumers have started to increase their short and long term inflation expectations which in turn may further slow the disinflationary process finally the federal open market committee decided at its january meeting to keep the federal funds rate unchanged signalling no hurry to adjust the interest rate given the still robust economy the march ecb staff projections foresee activity in the united states remaining solid in the near term led by strong growth in consumption although risks from us policies are accumulating following the pick up in real gdp growth in the fourth quarter of latest indicators point to a slowdown in both manufacturing and services activity a high frequency indicator for private consumption declined in january suggesting that the boost from previous fiscal support was short lived consumer confidence remains persistently negative thus weighing on a broader spending recovery with the main property market indicators also remaining sluggish while new us tariffs are estimated to have a rather modest adverse impact on gdp growth a further escalation of the us china conflict implies downside risks even though additional fiscal stimulus which had already been signalled by chinese authorities in december could mitigate this impact meanwhile chinese cpi inflation rose to in january while ppi inflation remained in negative territory at core cpi inflation excluding food and energy increased slightly to in january from the previous month mainly on account of a temporary increase in services prices following a pick up in activity helped by increased fiscal support for consumption overall sluggish domestic demand and overproduction are fuelling strong price competition among firms implying subdued inflationary pressures over the medium term the outlook for china is deteriorating as domestic demand remains weak and exports are being hit by higher us tariffs real gdp grew modestly quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter of as private demand and net trade made negative contributions which were partially offset by the positive impact from inventories and higher government spending weak short term indicators for private demand suggest that subdued growth might continue into headline cpi inflation rose to in january from in december driven mainly by food inflation headline cpi inflation is expected to remain elevated throughout supported by increases in energy prices and regulated price changes as well as the impact of government policies announced in the autumn budget e g an increase in the rate of employer national insurance contributions the bank of england lowered the key policy rate by basis points in its february meeting judging that domestic price pressures remained stable and that the recent pick up in headline cpi inflation will not lead to additional second round effects on underlying domestic inflationary pressures activity in the united kingdom remains modest amid persistent inflation economic activity na na na na na this means that output rose in all quarters of the year as a result gdp is estimated to have risen by in which represents an improvement vis à vis when it grew by short term indicators and available country data point to positive contributions from private consumption and investment offset by falling net exports while the contribution from changes in inventories was broadly neutral at the same time the industrial sector likely remained weak while the services sector was more resilient the fourth quarter outcome for the euro area generates a positive carry over effect to annual growth in according to eurostat s flash estimate real gdp edged up by quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter of chart na na uncertainty surrounding economic policy including trade policy is weighing on the near term outlook the predominant source of uncertainty on the global stage relates to us policies particularly in the security and trade domains increasing protectionism might disproportionately affect the manufacturing sector compared with other parts of the economy nonetheless the composite output purchasing managers index pmi rose to on average in january and february from in the fourth quarter largely on the back of an increase in manufacturing despite this recent improvement the manufacturing pmi still points to contracting activity with the index having now been below for almost two years chart the pmi for new orders has also improved recently but still remains below pointing to a weak short term outlook for industry in the services sector the pmi remains above the no growth threshold although the latest readings have been below its long term average the european commission s business confidence indicators portray a broadly similar picture survey data point to continued moderate services sector led growth in the first quarter of amid elevated uncertainty na na this was lower than in the other quarters of the year chart yet employment growth was resilient in relation to gdp growth leading to a decline in productivity of the unemployment rate stood at in december percentage points higher than in november remaining close to its lowest level since the euro was introduced labour demand has declined somewhat from the high levels seen after the pandemic with the job vacancy rate unchanged at in the fourth quarter percentage points lower than its peak in the second quarter of employment increased by in the fourth quarter of na na the monthly composite pmi employment indicator declined from in january to in february suggesting that employment in the first quarter is likely to be broadly unchanged compared with the fourth quarter of the pmi employment indicator for services declined from in january to in february while the pmi employment indicators for manufacturing and construction remained in contractionary territory short term labour market indicators point to stable employment in the first quarter of after increasing by quarter on quarter in the third quarter chart private consumption growth seems to have moderated in the fourth quarter of also reflecting the unwinding of some temporary factors that supported its expansion in the previous quarter e g the paris olympic and paralympic games this is corroborated by the quarter on quarter increase in retail sales and the quarter on quarter rise in services production incoming data point to moderating momentum in household spending growth in the short term as well as reflected in the latest ecb staff macroeconomic projections the european commission s consumer confidence indicator edged up further in february but remains subdued overall amid still high uncertainty the european commission s indicators of business expectations for demand in contact intensive services declined further in february while the ecb s latest consumer expectations survey indicates that expected holiday purchases remain robust despite some recent softening at the same time consumer expectations for major purchases in the next months edged up in february after deteriorating in the previous month going forward persisting economic policy uncertainty particularly in the context of global economic developments should continue to weigh on households spending decisions however higher purchasing power reflecting the slowdown in inflation and continued rises in real labour income are expected to support consumption in the quarters ahead private consumption growth likely moderated in the fourth quarter of na na following the marked contraction in the third quarter of business investment proxied in the national accounts by non construction investment excluding irish intangibles is expected to have increased slightly in the fourth quarter however investment in tangible assets has been particularly weak over recent quarters in the capital goods sector industrial production fell by quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter as anticipated by the pmi output indicators diving deep into negative territory over the course of last year and the industrial confidence indicator at levels last seen during the lockdown chart panel a intangible investment continues to grow although well below the rates seen in the united states see incoming data suggest weakness at the start of against a backdrop of elevated uncertainty surrounding geopolitical and economic policy as well as trade policy uncertainty the latest corporate telephone survey the survey on the access to finance of enterprises in the euro area and the bank lending survey all anticipate subdued investment at the start of the year with the latter expecting a further downtick in demand in the first quarter for the longer term loans typically associated with fixed investment these factors combined are likely to weigh on investment at the start of the year further ahead barring strong disruptions to trade the gradual pick up in the wider economy easing financing conditions and the resolution of some sources of uncertainty should support investment in addition ongoing deployments of next generation eu funds will help to further crowd in business investment business investment likely remained muted around the turn of the year amid high uncertainty na na after declining significantly from onwards housing investment seems to have bottomed out in the fourth quarter of as available country data suggest a slight increase in housing investment in the fourth quarter while production in building and specialised construction remained unchanged compared with the third quarter survey based activity indicators improved at the beginning of this year yet overall they continue to point to muted momentum in housing investment in the first quarter of with both the pmi indicator for housing production and the european commission s indicator for building and specialised construction activity in the last three months remaining in contractionary territory chart panel b however housing investment should gradually gain momentum as progresses according to the european commission s survey households short term intentions to buy or build a house increased further in the first quarter this improvement in sentiment is supported by falling mortgage rates and reflects a gradual recovery in housing loans suggesting that housing demand is slowly increasing housing investment remained largely stable in the fourth quarter of total extra euro area exports contracted by quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter this decline confirms the persisting competitiveness challenges faced by euro area exporters see even amid a recovery in global demand looking ahead surveys suggest that the performance of exports will continue to be subdued in the near term the latest pmis for new export orders remained well below the expansion threshold in february for both manufacturing and services at the same time monthly goods trade data suggest that quarterly import growth slowed in the fourth quarter suggesting an overall negative contribution of net exports to gdp euro area exports declined at a slower pace in the fourth quarter of according to the march ecb staff projections the economy is expected to grow by in in and in the downward revisions for and reflect lower exports and ongoing weakness in investment in part originating from high trade policy uncertainty as well as broader policy uncertainty rising real incomes and the gradually fading effects of the past rate hikes remain the key drivers underpinning the expected pick up in demand over time in the march projections the economic recovery is expected to be slower than anticipated in the december projections while uncertainty has increased prices and costs na na na this was primarily attributable to an expected decline in energy inflation which fell to in february from in january owing mainly to a downward base effect and a month on month decline in energy prices by contrast food inflation stood at in february up from in january reflecting a higher annual rate for unprocessed food prices while the rate for processed food prices was unchanged the hicpx edged down to in february from in january the first decline since september this reflected lower services inflation at in february down from in january and concealed a small increase in neig inflation in february up from in january the decline in services inflation in february is in line with earlier expectations of both an initial moderation driven by gradually easing wage growth and weaker repricing effects in early than in euro area headline inflation as measured by the harmonised index of consumer prices hicp decreased to in february from in january chart na na in january the latest month for which data are available the bulk of the indicator values ranged from to the persistent and common component of inflation pcci which tends to perform best as a predictor of future headline inflation was still at the bottom of this range while the weighted median indicator increased to hicpx inflation excluding travel related items clothing and footwear hicpxx was unchanged at whereas the supercore indicator which comprises hicp items that are sensitive to the business cycle decreased to although the indicator for domestic inflation remained at a persistently high level it edged down to in january from in december this was the first time it had declined since october the change was due mainly to lower contributions from restaurant and cafe prices as well as from insurance costs in the health and transport sectors most measures of underlying inflation are consistent with expectations that inflation will settle at around the medium term target on a sustained basis chart na na at the early stages of the pricing chain producer price inflation for energy which had been negative since april turned positive rising to in january from in december the annual growth rate of producer prices for domestic sales of intermediate goods increased to in january up from in december at the later stages of the pricing chain domestic producer price inflation for non food consumer goods increased to in january from in december while producer prices for the manufacturing of food products decreased slightly to in january from in december the latest available data for import prices at the cut off date for this report refer to december for intermediate goods the annual growth rate of import prices had continued to rise to in december up from in november meanwhile import price inflation for the manufacturing of food products had increased to in december possibly driven by the double digit growth rates of international food commodity prices the growth in import price inflation also reflects the depreciation of the euro overall the latest data on producer and import prices confirm that the gradual easing of accumulated pipeline pressures on consumer goods has been fading out but has not resulted in a noticeable reacceleration most indicators of pipeline pressures for goods increased but at still moderate rates chart na na the latest available national account data for domestic cost pressures for the euro area continue to refer to the third quarter of the annual growth rate of the gdp deflator declined to from in the previous quarter reflecting a smaller contribution from wages and unit labour costs unit profit growth remained in negative territory indicating that it is continuing to buffer still elevated labour cost pressures available data from national accounts for most of the euro area countries suggested that the moderating labour cost growth and profit buffering continued in the fourth quarter moreover other indicators available for the euro area in the fourth quarter such as the labour cost index and the negotiated wage indicator confirm the further easing of labour cost pressures growth in the hourly wages and salary component of the labour cost index declined to according to eurostat s flash estimate from in the third quarter growth in the negotiated wage indicator stood at in the fourth quarter down from in the third quarter moreover the ecb s forward looking wage tracker which includes data on negotiated wage agreements up to mid february keeps pointing to easing wage growth pressures at the beginning of this year looking forward the march ecb staff macroeconomic projections expect growth in compensation per employee to stand at on average for and to continue moderating to in domestic cost pressures as measured by growth in the gdp deflator fell further in the third quarter of although these remained elevated chart na na in both the ecb survey of professional forecasters for the first quarter of and the ecb survey of monetary analysts for march average and median longer term inflation expectations remained at shorter term survey expectations for also stood at around but saw small changes depending on the incorporation of the latest data outcomes and movements in energy commodity prices market based measures of short term inflation compensation as measured by the one year forward inflation linked swap rate one year ahead have recently edged up and stand at around looking at the medium and longer term market based measures of inflation compensation have also increased notably the five year forward inflation linked swap rate five years ahead stands at around having increased by about basis points since the december governing council meeting largely reflecting movements following the recently announced plans for fiscal budget expansion in europe this rise is mostly attributed to higher inflation risk premia consequently model based estimates of genuine inflation expectations excluding inflation risk premia indicate that market participants continue to expect inflation to be around in the longer term on the consumer side inflation expectations mostly resumed their downward momentum according to the ecb consumer expectations survey for january median expectations for headline inflation over the next months decreased to from in december while expectations for three years ahead remained unchanged at median inflation perceptions over the previous months declined slightly to in january there was little change in survey based indicators of longer term inflation expectations while market based measures of medium to longer term inflation compensation increased slightly with most standing at around chart na na headline inflation is projected to remain relatively stable in owing mainly to higher food inflation and base effects in energy prices which broadly offset lower core inflation it is then expected to gradually ease further in early as the base effects in energy inflation fade away the projected increase in headline inflation in mainly reflects a temporary upward impact from energy inflation owing to fiscal measures related to the climate change transition in particular the introduction of a new emissions trading scheme ets compared with the december projections the outlook for headline inflation has been revised up by percentage points for is unrevised for and has been revised down by percentage points for the upward revision for is mainly owing to upward data surprises for energy inflation and higher oil and electricity price assumptions hicpx inflation is expected to decline from in to in in and in primarily driven by a decrease in services inflation compared with the december projections hicpx inflation has been revised down by percentage points for and has been revised up by percentage points for the march ecb staff macroeconomic projections expect headline inflation to average in and to decline to in and in chart na na financial market developments na na the benchmark €str averaged over the review period following the governing council s widely anticipated decisions to lower the key ecb interest rates by basis points at both its december and january meetings excess liquidity decreased by around € billion to € billion this mainly reflected the repayments in december of funds borrowed in the third series of targeted longer term refinancing operations and the decline in the portfolios of securities held for monetary policy purposes with the eurosystem no longer reinvesting the principal payments from maturing securities the short end of the €str based ois forward curve repriced upwards during the review period pointing to a higher path for policy rates with significant intermittent fluctuations following the december governing council meeting short term interest rates rose across major advanced economies amid concerns that us disinflation was progressing more slowly than expected after peaking in mid january the euro area curve retracted as market participants anticipated a continuation of domestic disinflation and a weakening growth outlook with the latter partly attributable to heightening trade uncertainty however in the run up to the march governing council meeting the euro area curve rebounded against the backdrop of defence and infrastructure spending plans in european countries at the end of the review period the forward curve fully priced in a rate cut of basis points at the march governing council meeting and around basis points of cumulative cuts by the end of since the december governing council meeting the ois forward curve has repriced upwards na na by the end of the review period the ten year euro area ois rate had risen by around basis points to approximately despite significant fluctuations throughout the period the ten year ois rate climbed by around basis points from the start of the review period up to mid january on account of strong upward pressures originating from the united states however it subsequently retracted as market participants shifted their focus to the euro area outlook for inflation and the real economy finally at the end of the review period a ramp up in fiscal spending plans in europe caused long term risk free rates to increase by around basis points in the united states long term risk free rates initially rose by around basis points to reach their peak in mid january before falling from mid february onwards this retraction which has recently been cemented by signs that us economic growth may be slowing brought us rates down to around slightly below their levels at the beginning of the review period as a result the differential between ten year risk free rates in the euro area and the united states narrowed by basis points the ten year uk sovereign bond yield increased by basis points to stand at around at the end of the review period euro area long term risk free rates fluctuated over the review period and increased overall chart na na the ten year gdp weighted euro area sovereign bond yield closed the review period at around approximately basis points higher than its level at the start of the period this increase led to a widening of around basis points in the spread over the €str based ois rate french sovereign bond yields performed similarly to the gdp weighted euro area sovereign bond yield in spite of a recent perceived improvement in the country s political situation following the french parliament s approval of the budget the german sovereign bond spread widened by basis points remaining firmly in

    Area and US Monetary Policy

    By Jan Hatzius 1



1   Introduction
    Thank you to the ECB for inviting me to speak at the ECB Forum on Central
    Banking.

    I want to focus on one key aspect of geopolitics, namely the potential impact of a
    trade war on inflation, growth, and monetary policy in the Euro area and the US.

    Let me give you my conclusion up front. While our baseline view in the absence of a
    trade war is that the ECB and the Fed will lower policy rates by 150-200bp in the
    next two years, a global trade war could cause greater monetary policy divergence.
    The reason is that it would likely raise inflation by more in the US but would weigh on
    growth more in Europe.

    As you know, former President Trump has floated tariffs that are large by postwar
    standards. The main proposals are a 10% surcharge on all US imports and a 60%
    tariff on imports from China. Taken together, these proposals could raise the
    average US tariff rate by 16 percentage points to nearly 20%, which would be the
    highest in the postwar period.

    Tariff Rate

1.1   Trade Policy Scenario

      There is a lot of uncertainty about what policies former President Trump would
      impose if he returned to office, and even greater uncertainty about where tariff rates
      would settle after the inevitable negotiations drama. But to get a reference point, let's
      investigate the following scenario:

      1.   The US imposes an across-the-board tariff of 10% on all goods imports.

      2.   Everyone else (including the Euro area) responds by imposing a 10% tariff on
           imports from the US.

      3.   Each government recycles the tariff revenue into tax cuts.

      4.   The trade war results in a rise in global trade policy uncertainty to the levels
           observed at the peak of the 2018-2019 trade war. (I view this as a conservative
           assumption.)

      Such a policy change would have important effects on both inflation and growth.



2     Inflation Effects
      I first discuss the inflation effects. There are four effects to keep track of:

      1.   A direct boost from tariffs to consumer goods prices.

      2.   An indirect boost from tariffs to consumer goods prices via higher intermediate
           goods prices.

      3.   An effect from likely dollar appreciation induced by the tariffs, which is slightly
           inflationary in the Euro area and slightly disinflationary in the US.

      4.   A drag from standard Phillips curve effects resulting from weaker growth in both
           the Euro area and the US.

      Taken together, we estimate a relatively minor 0.1pp boost to Euro area inflation and
      a sizable 1.1pp boost to US inflation. The reason for the big gap is that the Euro area
      imports far less from the US than the US imports from the world.

    Proposed Tariffs Would Likely Have a Modest Inflation Impact in the Euro Area but a
    Larger Impact in the US

3   Growth Effects
    I next discuss the growth effects. There are again four effects to keep track of:

    1.     A hit from higher prices to real personal income and thus consumption.

    2.     A partial offset from our assumption that tariff revenue is fully recycled into tax
           cuts. (The offset is only partial because we assume that the benefit from tax
           cuts, on average, accrues to a higher income group with lower marginal
           propensities to consume than the hit from tariffs.)

    3.     A hit from increased trade policy uncertainty to business investment, which I will
           discuss further in a minute.

    4.     An effect from changes in net trade, which consists of the effect of tariffs on the
           relative demand for domestic vs. foreign produced goods as well as the impact
           of dollar appreciation. We estimate that net trade will have a negative impact in
           Europe and a positive impact in the US.

    Taken together, we estimate a substantial 1.0% hit to GDP in the Euro area and a
    more moderate 0.5% hit in the US.

      Chart 3
      Proposed Tariffs Would Likely Lower GDP by More in the Euro Area than the US

3.1   Uncertainty Effects

      This asymmetry reflects a more negative impact from trade policy uncertainty on
      investment in the Euro area than in the US. Trade policy uncertainty has recently
      started to rise again, and would undoubtedly rise much further if a sharp rise in tariffs
      became imminent.

      Chart 4
      Trade Policy Uncertainty Rose Significantly During the 2018-2019 Trade War and
      Has Recently Ticked Up




      Sources: Federal Reserve Board, Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research.


      To estimate the impact of trade policy uncertainty on growth, we use three analytical
      approaches:

    1.     A firm-level regression of the link between mentions of trade policy uncertainty
           in quarterly earnings calls vs. changes in investment in both Europe and the
           US.

    2.     A firm-level regression of the link between stock returns around trade policy
           news events and changes in investment in Europe and the US.

    3.     A cross-country analysis of the link between trade policy uncertainty and
           investment growth across 34 countries since 1962.

    The estimated effects differ somewhat across approaches, but they are consistently
    larger in the Euro area. On average across the approaches, we find that a return to
    the 2018-2019 trade policy uncertainty peak would shave 0.9% off GDP in the Euro
    area but only 0.3% in the US.

    Chart 5
    A Rise in Trade Policy Uncertainty to the 2018-2019 Peak Would Likely Subtract
    More from Euro Area than US Growth




    Sources: Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research.




4   Implications for Monetary Policy
    Lastly, I want to discuss the implications of these estimates for monetary policy. To
    do this, I simply plug the price and GDP estimates into a standard Taylor rule, with
    coefficients of 1.5 for inflation and 0.5 for GDP.

    In the Euro area, the effect is slightly dovish to the tune of -40bp, because the large
    dovish growth effect outweighs the small hawkish inflation effect.

    In the US, the implication is hawkish, to the tune of 130bp, because the large
    hawkish inflation effect clearly outweighs the smaller dovish growth effect.

Chart 6
Under Standard Taylor Rule, Proposed Tariffs Point to Modestly Lower Policy Rate in
the Euro Area but Higher Rate in the US




Sources: Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research.


In considering the hawkish impact on Fed policy, I would note two caveats:

First, the inflation effect of a trade war is really a price level effect. Barring continued
escalation, it should drop out of the year-on-year inflation numbers after a year, like
the well-known effects of a VAT hike.

Second, there are other important forces—in particular the continued disinflation and
labor market rebalancing from the post-pandemic time—which argue for significant
Fed rate cuts in a baseline that does not include a new trade war.

Both caveats suggest that a trade war is not necessarily a reason for the Fed to hike
rates. It may not even be a reason for the Fed to forego cuts altogether. But if it
keeps core PCE inflation above 3% instead of near 2% in 2025, it might well be a
reason to delay cuts that might otherwise occur more quickly.

Before closing, I want to reiterate that there is a lot of uncertainty around what would
happen to trade policy in a second Trump administration. It is possible that the
inevitable trade negotiations would result in tariff levels that are ultimately
considerably more minor. In that case, tariffs would be less important for monetary
policy than my discussion suggests.

But the uncertainty is two-sided and the trade war could also be considerably more
pronounced. A trade war between the US and China would significantly amplify our
results, with a bigger increase in US inflation, a bigger hit to European growth, and a
stronger case for monetary policy divergence between Europe and the US.

Well, it's an honor to be here in the Oval Office with the president and leader of the free world. We're very happy and we're very eager to -- and we're a small country, but if we can help, we will do it. And we actually -- that was the journalist call it, murder capital of the world into the safest country in the Western Hemisphere -- if they saw the -- president, you have 350 million people to liberate.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 But to liberate 350 million people, you have to imprison some. That's the way it works, right? You cannot just free the criminals and think crime's going to go down magically. You have to imprison them, so you can liberate 350 million Americans that are asking for the end of crime and the end of terrorism.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And it can be done. I mean, you're doing it already. And I'm sure that people have seen the change in the streets, a long way to go because you're just initiating your second term. But it's clear that with the numbers at the border, even in Democrat-run cities, they get help from the work you're doing. So I'm really happy to be here, honored, and eager to help.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Well, we had a terrible thing happen. We had an administration that allowed people to come in freely into our country, from not only South America but from all over the world, many from the Congo, in Africa, Asia, all over the world, Europe, rough parts of Europe. And they came from prisons and they came from mental institutions and they came from gangs, the gangs of Venezuela and other places.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And hundreds of thousands and even millions of them came. 21 million people all together, but many of the people that came just a tremendous percentage of them were criminals, in some cases, violent criminals. We had 11,088 known murderers. Half of them murdered more than one person. This was allowed by a man who, what he did to our country is just unbelievable, so we're straightening it out.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 We're getting them out. But what they did and what that party did to our country open borders, anybody could come in. As soon as I heard that, I said every prison is going to be emptied out into our country. That's what happened and we're straightening it out. And we just had numbers. We had the highest recruiting numbers in the history of our country going into police departments.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And a year ago, we had the lowest numbers. You couldn't hire a police --
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Biggest change. The lowest to the highest.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Nobody's ever seen -- and the military now, Marines, the Army, Air Force, Coast Guard, every slot is -- I mean, we have the best numbers we've ever had. We call it recruitment, recruitment numbers, and we've never had anything like it. We had records at every single level, but very important, the policemen.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 The policemen are joining forces now that we really were having a hard time with policemen because we weren't protecting our police. And we cherish our police. The police are great and the firemen and everybody else. But we have the highest numbers that we've ever had, the most enthusiasm. We have great enthusiasm.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And on trade and other things, we're doing great. We're taking in billions and billions of dollars. We made -- two weeks ago, I gave him a little bit of a pause because you know you have to show a little flexibility, but we go back to what we have to do. The markets have been very strong once they got used to it, but we were losing $2 billion a day.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 There's no company big like this.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 No.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 This is the biggest deal ever made. Now we're making $3 billion a day. We're a great country, but we had stupid people running this country and I can say it, but what they've done to us at the border should never and can never be forgotten. It's a sin, what they did. And you are helping us out and we appreciate it.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Thanks. Thank you. Actually, what you're doing with the border is remarkable. It has dropped, what, 95 percent? It's incredible.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 As of this morning, 99 percent, 99.1 percent to be exact.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Why are those numbers not in the media?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Well, they get up with the fake news. You know, like CNN, CNN over here doesn't want to put them out because they don't like putting out good numbers. They only like putting out -- because I think they hate our country, actually. It's a shame. You're right. Isn't that a great question, why doesn't the media -- why don't they put out numbers?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Yeah, 99 percent, I mean, it's crazy, right? It's a crazy turnaround.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Kristi, could you maybe say a couple of words about the border, how we're doing?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 It's just been absolutely phenomenal, what a great leader can do, clear direction. Our laws matter. We should only have people in our country that love us and the Border Patrol and our ICE officers and law enforcement officers have done fantastic work. So, we're proud of them. Now we just need to get the criminals and murderers and rapists and dangerous gang members and terrorist organizations out of our country.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 So, Mr. -- President Bukele, we thank you very much for your partnership. It has been wonderful for us to be able to have somewhere to send the worst of the worst and someone to partner with. And we'd like to continue that partnership because it's been a powerful message of consequences. Mr. President, you wanted people to know that there was consequences if you break our laws and harm our people and endanger families.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And this is a clear consequence for the worst of the worst that we have somewhere to put them.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Thank you very much. Yeah, we even had this gang member from Venezuela, one of the ones you sent, and we interviewed him just to get some information, etc., from them. And he said, oh, you know, I got arrested six times, but they released me there six times. So, I should be released again. And then I said, well, what's the last thing you do. And he said, well, I shot a cop in the leg, but I didn't kill him, I just shot him in the leg.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And we're like this guy was arrested six times, here in the United States six times, he was released six times and in the last -- no, he was released five times. And the last time he was sent to El Salvador, right, so he's not getting released. But the last thing, he shot a cop actually and he shot him in the leg.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 So, these are --
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 [Crosstalk]
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 -- yeah, I mean, yeah, there's something broken.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 The liberal establishment. But they're not running things anymore in this country. And we're run by -- and I don't say conservative, I don't say anything. We're run by people with great common sense.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Yeah, common sense.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Because it's all common sense, it's not liberal, conservative, it's common sense. And like do you allow men to play in women's sports? Do you allow men to box your women and box -- because I know you have a lot of boxers --
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 That's violence. That's abusive to women.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 That's abusive --
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 [Crosstalk]
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 It's abusive [Inaudible]
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Totally.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 But we have people that fight to the death because they think men should be able to play in women's sports. And some of those sports it wouldn't matter much, but it still matters. But some of them are very dangerous for women.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Some years ago, I would say a decade ago or so, women's rights movements were pressuring so that we enacted specific laws to avoid men abusing women. And I think those laws were great because there were a lot of men abusing women. But now some of the same people are trying to backtrack on that and actually trying to make new laws allowing men to abuse women in sports.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 So, actually that doesn't make sense.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 You do it in sports.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 It doesn't make sense. It's crazy.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 You know they have weightlifting lifting records, right? A woman gets up, lifts weight, she's incredible, a guy gets up and beats her by 100 pounds. What are you going to do? A record that hadn't been broken in 18 years, they put on an ounce and an ounce, quarter of an ounce, eighth of an ounce for 18 years.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Now they have a guy come up, pint, the whole thing is crazy, but they continue to fight. And I don't like talking about it because I want to save it for just before the next election. I said to my people don't even talk about it because they'll change, and we'll have a -- But I watched this morning, there was a congressman fighting to the death for men to play against women in sports.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And you say to yourself, why? What are they doing, right? What are they doing? But your country is not too big in that.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 No, of course not. We're big in protecting women.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Good, that's right. That's a very important form of protection too.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And as you can see, most of my cabinet are women, so --
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 That's impressive.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Yeah, yeah. They're not the [Inaudible] I hire for anything. They're just great at what they do, right?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 That's right. This is very impressive. This is a first. We've had women, but we've never had three of them right here.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Four and three men.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Look who we have. You guys feel a little bit mistreated [Laughter]. That's good. I like it. I like it. Well, we've been advanced. I've been very advanced in that regard too. We have Pam, who's been so fantastic.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Yes, I know. Kristi and --
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Kristi, and the most powerful woman they say.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 I know, exactly.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 They're all afraid of Susie Wells. They say, oh, she's tough. Most powerful woman in the world, according to magazines. What do I know? But I think she probably is -- she probably is.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Congratulations.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And you know Stephen who has done such a great job. We have just -- we have great people.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 He's very famous, too [Laughter]
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 But we love working [Laughter] he really lets them have it, right?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Yeah, exactly.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 There's no games.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 No, no, no, it's very good.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 He knows. Do you have any questions, please? Let's not start with CNN because they're so -- they're just so wrong. Yeah, please.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Yeah, thank you. Mr. President, you repeatedly mentioned last night that Russia's attack on Ukraine was a mistake. What is the exact mistake? And have you given Putin a deadline to actually move toward a ceasefire?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Yeah. The mistake was letting the war happen. If Biden were competent. And if Zelenskyy were competent -- and I don't know that he is, we had a rough session with this guy over here. He just kept asking for more and more. That war should have never been allowed to happen. That war -- I went four years, and Putin wouldn't even bring it up. And as soon as the election was rigged, and I wasn't here, that war started.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 There was no way that war should have been allowed to happen, and Biden should have stopped. And you take a look at Putin -- I'm not saying anybody's an angel, but I will tell you, I went four years, and it wasn't even a question. He would never -- and I told him don't do it. You're not going to do it. And it was the apple of his eye but there was no way that he would have done it. All you had to do is lower oil prices.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 If you lowered oil prices -- Biden kept the prices so high because he made it impossible to get it. If you lowered oil prices, you would have never had the war, but you wouldn't have had it with me anyway. That war would have never happened. And I think it's a great abuse. So, now what do you? You get a country where 25 percent of its land is gone and the best locations where millions of people are killed.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 You know, you haven't reported accurately the death, and this was Biden's war and I'm trying to stop it and I think we're going to do a good job. I hope we're going to do. They lose 2,500 young people a week on average. Now they're Russians and they're Ukrainians, but it's 2,000 -- we don't care, it's like whatever it is.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 It's intolerable.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 They're not from your country, they're not from mine, but I want to stop it. 2,500, it's a killing field, it's like the Civil War. You take a look -- I look at the satellite pictures. This should not be happening in our time. Of course, our time can be pretty violent, as we know, but that's a war that should have never been allowed to start.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And Biden could have stopped it, and Zelenskyy could have stopped it, and Putin should have never started it. Everybody's to blame.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Have you spoken to President Zelenskyy, sir, about his offer to purchase more Patriot missile batteries?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 I don't know. He's always looking to purchase missiles. He's against -- listen, when you start a war, you've got to know that you can win the war, right? You don't start a war against somebody that's 20 times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles. If we didn't give them what we gave -- remember, I gave them javelins, that's how they won their first big battle, with the tanks that got stuck in the mud and they took them out with javelins.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 They have an expression that Obama at the time -- Obama gave them sheets and Trump gave them javelins. But just something that should have never happened. It's a really shame -- the towns are destroyed; towns and cities are largely destroyed. They have the spires; you know, the beautiful spires that go up. They say that were the most beautiful in the world in Ukraine for whatever reason.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 But the most beautiful in the world, they're mostly lying on their side shattered and broken. And most importantly, you have millions of people dead. Millions of people dead because of three people, I would say three people. Let's say Putin number one, but let's say Biden who had no idea what the hell he was doing, number two; and Zelenskyy and all I can do is try and stop it. That's all I want to do. I want to stop the killing, and I think we're doing well in that regard.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 It should -- I think you'll have some very good proposals very soon.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Last question, sir. Have you attributed a motive -- sir, have you attributed a motive for the FBI investigation behind the attack on Governor Josh Shapiro over the weekend?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 No, I haven't. But the attacker was not a fan of Trump, I understand just from what I read and from what I've been told. The attacker basically wasn't a fan of anybody. He's probably just a whack job. And certainly, a thing like that cannot be allowed to happen.

In fact, you sort of look like a teenager, he looked like a teenager. I said what kind of a country is this --

Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 I support him. Go ahead. Let's hear the question from this very low-rated anchor at CNN, low-rated.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Thank you, President Trump. Do you plan to ask President [Inaudible] to help return the man who your administration says was mistakenly deported?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Which one is that?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 The man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Well, let me ask, Pam, would you answer that question?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Sir, President. First and foremost, he was illegally in our country. He had been illegally in our country. And in 2019, two courts, an immigration court and an appellate immigration court ruled that he was a member of MS-13 and he was illegally in our country. Right now, it was a paperwork. It was additional paperwork that needed to be done.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 That's up to El Salvador, if they want to return him. That's not up to us. The Supreme Court ruled, President, that if as El Salvador wants to return him, this is international matters, foreign affairs. If they wanted to return him, we would facilitate it, meaning provide a plane.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 So will you return him?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 You are doing a great job. Thank you, Pam.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Thank you.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Stephen Miller. Wait a minute. Could you just also respond to that question, because it's asked by CNN and they always ask it with a slant, because they're totally slanted because they don't know what's happening. That's why nobody's watching them. But would you answer that question also, please?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Yes, gladly. So as Pam mentioned, there's an illegal alien from El Salvador. So with respect to you, he's a citizen of El Salvador. So it's very arrogant even for American media to suggest that we would even tell El Salvador how to handle their own citizens, as a starting point. As to immigration courts found that he was a member of MS-13, when President Trump declared MS-13 to be a foreign terrorist organization that meant that he was no longer eligible -- under federal law, which I'm sure you know.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 You're very familiar with the INA, that he was no longer eligible for any form of immigration relief in the United States. So he had a deportation order that was valid, which meant that under our law, he's not even allowed to be present in the United States and had to be returned because of the foreign terrorist designation.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 This issue was then, by a district court judge, completely inverted. And a district court judge tried to tell the administration that they had to kidnap a citizen of El Salvador and fly him back here. That issue was raised to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court said the district court order was unlawful and its main components were reversed, nine-zero, unanimously, stating clearly that neither secretary of state nor the president could be compelled by anybody to forcibly retrieve a citizen of El Salvador from El Salvador, who again, is a member of MS-13, which as I'm sure you understand, rapes little girls, murders women, murders children, is engaged in the most barbaric activities in the world.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And I can promise you, if he was your neighbor, you would move right away.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 So you don't plan to [Inaudible]
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And what was the ruling in the Supreme Court, Steve, was it nine to nothing?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Yes, it was a nine to zero.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 In our favor?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 In our favor, against the district court ruling, saying that no district court has the power to compel the foreign policy function of the United States. As Pam said, the ruling solely stated that if this individual at El Salvador's sole discretion was sent back to our country, that we could deport him a second time.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 No version of this legally ends up with him ever living here because he is a citizen of El Salvador. That is the president of El Salvador. Your questions about it for the court can only be directed to him.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 I ask the president on this -- can President Bukele weigh in on this? Do you plan to return him?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Well, I'm [Inaudible] not suggesting that I smuggle a terrorist into the United States, right? I mean, how can I smuggle -- how can I return him to the United States, like, I smuggle him into the United States, or what do I do? Of course, I'm not going to do it. It's like -- I mean, the question is preposterous.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? I don't have the power to return him to the United States.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 But you could release him inside El Salvador.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Yeah, but I'm not releasing. I mean, we're not very fond of releasing terrorists into our country. We just turned the murder capital of the world into the safest country in the Western Hemisphere. And you want us to go back into releasing criminals so we can go back to being the murder capital of the world, no, that's not going to happen.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Well, they'd love to have a criminal released into our country.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Yeah. I mean, there's a fascination --
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 They would love it.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Yeah.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 These are sick people. Marco, do you have something to say about?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Yeah. I mean, Stephen outlined it. I don't understand what the confusion is. This individual is a citizen of El Salvador. He was illegally in the United States and was returned to his country. That's where you deport people, back to their country of origin, except for Venezuela that was refusing to take people back, or places like that.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 I can tell you this, Mr. President, the foreign policy of the United States is conducted by the president of the United States, not by a court. And no court in the United States has a right to conduct the foreign policy of the United States. It's that simple, end of story.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 But more specifically --
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And that's what the Supreme Court held, by the way, to Marco's point. The Supreme Court said exactly what Marco said, that no court has the authority to compel the foreign policy of the United States. We won a case nine-zero, and people like CNN are portraying it as a loss as usual, because they want foreign terrorists in the country who kidnap women and children.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 But President Trump, his policy is foreign terrorists that are here illegally get expelled from the country, which by the way, is a 90-10 issue.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Well, Mr. President, you said that if the Supreme Court said someone needed to be returned, that you would abide by that. You said that on Air Force One just a few days ago.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 How long do we have to answer this question from you? Why don't you just say, isn't it wonderful that we're keeping criminals out of our country? Why can't you just say that? Why do you go over and over? And that's why nobody watches you anymore. You have no credibility. Please, go ahead.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 President Trump, thank you so much. How many illegal criminals are you planning on exporting to El Salvador? And President Bukele, how many are you willing to take from US?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 As many as possible. And I just asked the president, it's this massive complex that he built jail complex, I said, can you build some more of them, please? As many as we can get out of our country that were allowed in here by incompetent Joe Biden through open borders, open borders. You probably hear open borders and you can't even understand it because nobody can understand.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Nobody smart or with common sense can understand it. So we have millions of people that should not be in this country, that are dangerous, not just people, because we have people. But we have millions of people that are murderers, drug dealers. They've been allowed to come into our country by other countries that were very smart.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 When they heard that this very low IQ president, and by the way, I took my cognitive exam as part of my physical exam and I got the highest mark. And one of the doctors said, sir, I've never seen anybody get that kind of -- that was the highest mark. I hope you're happy with that, although they haven't been bugging me too much to take a cognitive.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 But I did do my physical and it was released. I hope you're all happy with it. I noticed there's no questions, so probably you are. But the cognitive, they said to me, sir, would you like to take a cognitive test? I said, did Biden take one? No. Did anybody take one? No, not too many people took them. I said, what about Obama, did he take one?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 No, he didn't take one either. I said, let me be the only one to take one. But I've actually taken them three times already. I like taking them because they're not too tough for me to take. But we had a great physical exam, so I know you're going to ask that. And the doctors who are total professionals, Walter Reed Medical Center, they're great, great people.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And I visited a soldier that was badly wounded, incredible soldier, lost his leg. And we spent a lot of time with him. I mean, great with his mother, and it was really a very great thing. They do a phenomenal job. I just want to say, Walter Reed, I was there for, what, five or six hours You were there with me. But I took a full physical and it came out perfecto, so that's good.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 That means you've got me for a little longer.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Would the United States be willing to pay for those facilities to be open if [Inaudible]
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 I'd do something. We'd help them out. Yeah, we'd help them out. They're great facilities, very strong facilities and they don't play games. I'd like to go a step further. I mean, I said it to Pam. I don't know what the laws are. We always have to obey the laws, but we also have homegrown criminals that push people into subways, that hit elderly ladies on the back of the head with a baseball bat when they're not looking, that are absolute monsters.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 I'd like to include them in the group of people to get them out of the country, but you'll have to be looking at the laws on that, Steve, OK?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 [Inaudible] and do you think more presidents should follow suit like you guys, as far as taking a hard stance on crime here in the United States?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Well, I do. I think everybody has to. I mean, the president said it better than anybody. He said, you have liberty and you have to have liberty, but to have liberty, not everybody is going to be good. And some are bad because they're sick, they're mentally deranged, they're bad. And you have to take them -- if you're going to have a country, you're going to have to take those people out, and we've been doing that.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 But this was an unforced error, they would call it, where we had people that may hate our country or maybe they're just stupid people. I think they're probably stupid people, more so. A lot of people said they did it for the vote, but I did better with Hispanic people than they did because they always used Hispanic.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 I did better. Your people love me. I saw my poll numbers in your country. I'm through the roof, right, 91 percent. No, no, they, they -- some people think they do it for the vote, but they don't have to do it for the vote. They cheat. You know, they're professional cheaters. That's about the only thing they do well.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 So, we just have had a great relationship, and it's become bigger because of a strange thing that happened. I came back; we had no war in Ukraine. We had no war with -- we had no October 7th, Middle East problem. We had nothing. We had no inflation. We didn't have the Afghanistan most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 The Afghanistan -- not withdrawing because I would have been out, you know, I had it all set to bring people out with dignity and pride. That was the worst most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, Afghanistan. We didn't have any of that. You wouldn't have had the war with Russia-Ukraine, you wouldn't have had the Middle East problem because Iran was broke.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 They had no money because we had secondary sanctions on and lots of other sanctions. And now every single thing -- got a problem with Iran, but I'll solve that problem. That's almost an easy one. We've got to solve a war that should have never started, Ukraine and Russia, and we'll get that solved. And we have to solve problems, and we already solved inflation.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 If you look at the numbers, the numbers are incredible actually. Stock market's up and we're not letting other countries take advantage of this country like they have for the last 40 years. So, thank you very much. Do you have a question, please?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Mr. President, thank you so much. You scored another major investment win this morning. Nvidia pledged to build its AI supercomputer for the first time ever right here in the United States.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 That's a question I like. That's true.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 What is your reaction to this announcement, sir? And how will this positively benefit Americans across the country?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Well, it's one of the biggest announcements you'll ever hear because Nvidia, as you know, controls that -- almost the entire sector, which is one of the most important sectors in the world, between chips and semiconductors and everything else. And they're the biggest and the other biggest we already have coming in and spending $300 billion, as you know, they announced two weeks ago.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 But Nvidia is so highly respected, and this was an announcement that a lot of people -- I knew it was going to happen, but not to the extent that it happened, it's big. And the reason they did it is because of the election on November 5th. And because of a thing called tariffs, as I say, the most beautiful word in the dictionary -- after love, God, relationship, the press actually hit me. I said tariff is the most beautiful word in the dictionary.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 What about family, love, God, I got hit even on that. Do you understand? I said, OK, so now I say it's my fifth most favorite word because they get you on anything. But no, Nvidia, it's one of the great companies of the world, modern, super modern companies, controls segments that nobody -- sort of controls the world in a sense.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And they're coming in here in the biggest way with hundreds of billions of dollars, not like millions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars. And I'm honored by it. And I want to thank Jensen and all of the people that we deal with, they're great people, they're brilliant people. And without tariffs, they wouldn't be doing it. Thank you very much.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Yeah, please, go ahead.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 President Trump, are you considering additional sanctions against Russia after their latest attack? And do you have an update on the rate and when you might announce them? Well, I already have sanctions on Russia, I put them there. If you remember, Nord Stream 2, that's the big pipeline that goes through Europe.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 I stopped it. That's Russia's pipeline, the largest pipeline, I think, in the world goes to Germany and I stopped it. And when Biden came in, he approved it and then they say, oh, I'm friendly with Russia. No, no. Putin said, you know, if you're my friend, I'd hate to see you when you're my enemy. I stopped the biggest -- the biggest economic job they ever had, I stopped it cold, right?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 It was dead, you know that, right. And Biden came in and he immediately approved it. What was that --
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 [Crosstalk]
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 -- all about? And it's a pipeline that takes care of a lot of the needs. Now, you know, it was a very controversial thing, but I stopped it, and Biden approved it. Question. No, not you again, not you again.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Go ahead, go ahead.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 [Crosstalk]
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 -- compete with pharmaceuticals -- semiconductor tariffs and [Inaudible] pharmaceuticals?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Pharmaceuticals we're going to do. We have -- we don't make our own drugs, our own pharmaceuticals. We don't make our own drugs anymore. The drug companies are in Ireland and they're in lots of other places, China. And all I have to do is impose a tariff. The more, the faster they move in. \The higher the tariff -- it's very [Inaudible], it's inversely proportional.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 The higher the tariff, the faster they come. And, yeah, we're going to be doing that. That's going to be like we have on cars. We have, as you know, a 25 percent tariff on cars. We have a 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminum and that's what that category fits right now.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Do you have a percentage in mind and a timeline?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 I have a timeline. Yeah, not too distant future. And we're doing it because we want to make our own drugs. We're doing it because we want to make our own steel and aluminum, lumber, other things. And they're all coming in. We have record numbers, $7 trillion since I announced like a month and a half ago -- since I came -- basically since I came in, we have over $7 trillion being invested in the country.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 We didn't have $1 trillion; we didn't have $0.5 trillion with some of these guys. They didn't know what the hell they were doing. So, we have the largest investment that we've ever heard of and we're only two months in. And that will continue at levels that you've never seen before. That's what's going to happen.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And even the stock market's up today. We also had, you know -- a lot of people didn't say it the way it was. We had the largest gain in the stock market in history on every single category last week. That was a nice game because we got a little hit because people didn't understand the power of our economic -- our country economically if you use it right.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Do you have something to say on that, J.D.?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Yes, sir. I mean, look, for 40 years, we have lost manufacturing capacity. Workers have seen their wages stagnate. And some of the most critical things that we need from the pharmaceuticals, the drugs that we give to our children, the antibiotics that we give to our kids to the weapons that we actually need to fight a war, if, God forbid, we had to fight a War. We don't make enough of that stuff.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And so, President Trump ran explicitly on changing that. Yes, as the president mentioned, it caused a little bit of disruption in the market. But I actually think over the long term, workers are going to benefit, stocks are going to go up, American businesses are going to benefit as we reinvest and reindustrialize our country.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And the auto workers and the Teamsters and all of the unions, not traditionally republican, but I'm winning those unions by -- we're up 40, 50 points on the democrats. They're losing everything. They're losing everything because they just have policies that are not believable. They fight for policies that are 5 percent popular, and nobody knows who the 5 percent are.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 I mean, nobody can find the 5 percent. But if you go back to Ohio -- and by the way, we have the great championship team from Ohio coming in today, right?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Very big day.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And that's going to be a little bit later, but -- and that'll be -- if you want to stick around, I'll introduce you to some nice people. You'll see some very large people, right? You'll see some people that -- even you have not seen the people like this. These are big, these are six foot, seven, 380 pounds with no fat.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Okay, that's pretty good, but the team, the national championship team is being honored today at the White House. So that'll be exciting. If you're around, want to stay around, I'll have you up there. You can tell them all about your prison, how you have to behave when you go to prison [Laughter]. OK, any -- who else is there?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Go ahead, please, behind you?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 You said yesterday that you're making a decision on Iran very quickly. What do you mean by that? Is that --
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 [Crosstalk]
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Well, they have to solve their problem very quickly. Iran wants to deal with us, but they don't know how. They really don't know how. We had a meeting with them on Saturday. We have another meeting scheduled next Saturday. I said that's a long time -- you know, that's a long time, so I think that might be tapping us along.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 But Iran has to get rid of the concept of a nuclear weapon. They cannot have a nuclear weapon. He can't have a nuclear weapon. Nobody can have -- we can't have anybody have any nuclear weapons. You can't have nuclear weapons. And I think they're tapping us along because they were so used to dealing with stupid people in this country.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And I had Iran perfect, you had no attacks, you would have never had October 7th in Israel, the attack by Hamas, because Iran was broke. They were stone cold broke when I was president. And I don't want to do it. I want them to be a rich, great nation. The only thing is -- one thing, simple, it's really simple -- they can't have a nuclear weapon.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And they've got to go fast because they're fairly close to having one. And they're not going to have one. And if we have to do something very harsh, we'll do it. And I'm not doing it for us, I'm doing it for the world and these are radicalized people, and they cannot have a nuclear weapon.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Does that include a potential strike on Iranian nuclear facilities?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Of course it does.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And just a follow up question, a clarification. You mentioned that you're open to deporting individuals that aren't foreign aliens, or criminals to El Salvador.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Love it.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Does that include potentially US citizens, fully naturalized Americans?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 If they're criminals and if they hit people with baseball bats over their head, that happened to be 90 years old. And if they rape 87-year-old women in Coney Island, Brooklyn, yeah, yeah, that includes them. Why, do you think they're a special category of person? They're as bad as anybody that comes in. We have bad ones too.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And I'm all for it, because we can do things with the president for less money and have great security. And we have a huge prison population. We have a huge number of prisons and then we have the private prisons and some are operated well, I guess, and some aren't. But he does a great job with that. We have others that we're negotiating with too, but no, if it's a homegrown criminal, I have no problem.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Now, we're studying the laws right now. Pam is studying. If we can do that, that's good. And I'm talking about violent people. I'm talking about really bad people, really bad people, every bit as bad as the ones coming in. And I made the statement when I heard about this a long time ago now, four years ago.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 When I heard that this guy was having open borders, I said, every single criminal from all over the world is going to be dumped into our country and that's what happened, jails. The jails of the Congo were emptied out. The jails of Venezuela were emptied out and you know what happened? Their crime went way down.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 But now Venezuela has other problems. You know what the problem is? They have no money.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Yeah.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Because I shut off their oil and we put secondary tariffs, because they're not doing what's right over there. They know what to do. We spoke to them. I spoke to them. They know what to do, but they have no money. Venezuela has no money. But Iran had no money and Iran behaved so beautifully. And then Biden took all those secondary tariffs and tariffs on. I told China, you can't buy oil.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 If you buy oil from Iran, China, I told it to President Xi, that we no longer want you to do business with the United States of America. And those ships disappeared from that harbor so quickly. China. Get along great with China.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Are the talks with Iran productive? Do you want to continue that?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 What?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 The talks with Iran, do you believe those are productive? Do you want to continue that?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 I think Iran could be a great country as long as it doesn't have nuclear weapons. If they have nuclear weapons, they'll never get a chance to be a great country. They will never get a chance. It won't even come close.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Sir, on tarrifs?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Yeah.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Yeah, thank you. Yesterday, you mentioned short-lived product exemptions. Which specific products are you considering and how long is short-lived, weeks, months?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 I'm looking at something to help some of the car companies, where they're switching to parts that were made in Canada, Mexico and other places. And they need a little bit of time because they're going to make them here, but they need a little bit of time. So I'm talking about things like that.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 What about any Apple products, other cell phones?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Look, I'm a very flexible person. I don't change my mind, but I'm flexible and you have to be. You just can't have a wall and you'll only go -- no, sometimes you have to go around it under it or above it. There'll be maybe things coming up. I speak to Tim Cook. I helped Tim Cook recently, and that whole business.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 I don't want to hurt anybody, but the end result is we're going to get to the position of greatness for our country. We're the greatest economic power in the world if we're smart. If we're not smart, we're going to hurt our country very badly. We lost with China over the Biden years, trillions of dollars on trade, trillions of dollars.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And he let them fleece us and we can't do that anymore. And you know what, I don't blame China at all. I don't blame President Xi. I like him. He likes me. I mean, I think, who knows, who the hell cares? But you know what -- what?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 Do you have any updates with talks with China?
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 No, let me just tell you this. I don't blame China. I don't blame Vietnam. I see they're meeting today, is that wonderful? That's a lovely meeting. They're meeting, like, trying to figure out, how do we screw the United States of America? Don't forget, the European Union was formed to do just that. The European Union was formed to hurt the United States on trade.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And they get us on NATO because they don't pay their bills. But now since I got involved, they have been paying their bills. I took in over $600 billion for NATO. Nobody took in anything. I mean, they were all delinquent. They had eight nations out of 28 paid their bills. The rest of them were way delinquent.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And I said, if you don't pay your bills, we're not going to protect you anymore, and the money poured in, over 600 -- the secretary general last week made that statement. He said, I've never seen anything like it. We couldn't get anybody to pay because the United States was footing the bill for NATO. Well, we got hurt there and we got hurt on trade, likewise, European Union.
Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025 And they've got to come to the table, and they're trying to. They're trying to. But the European Union has taken terrible advantage. They don't take our food products. They don't take our cars. We have millions of their cars, BMW, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, many others.

donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april and on trade and other things we re doing great we re taking in billions and billions of dollars we made two weeks ago i

losing $ billion a day remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april there s no company big like this remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april no remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april this is the biggest deal ever made now we re making $ billion a day we re a great

only have people in our country that love us and the border patrol and our ice officers and law enforcement officers have done fantastic work so we re proud of them now we just need to get the criminals and murderers and rapists and dangerous gang members and terrorist organizations out of our country remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april so mr president bukele we thank you very much for your partnership it has been wonderful for us to be able to have somewhere to send the worst of the worst and someone to partner with and we d like to continue that partnership because it s been a powerful message of consequences mr president you wanted people to know that there was consequences if you break our laws and harm our people and endanger families remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april and this is a clear consequence for the worst of the worst that we have somewhere to put them remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april thank you very much yeah we even had this gang member from venezuela one of the ones you sent and we interviewed him just to get some information etc from them and he said oh you know i got arrested six times but they released me there six times so i should be released again and then i said well what s the last thing you do and he said well i shot a cop in the leg but i didn t kill him i just shot him in the leg remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april and we re like this guy was arrested six times here in the united states six times he was released six times and in the last no he was released five times and the last time he was sent to el salvador right so he s not getting released but the last thing he shot a cop actually and he shot him in the leg remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april so these are remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april crosstalk remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april yeah i mean yeah there s something broken remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april the liberal establishment but they re not running things anymore in this country and we re run by

of el salvador april totally remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april but we have people that fight to the death because they think men should be able to play in women s sports and some of those sports it wouldn t matter much but it still matters but some of them are very dangerous for women remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april some years ago i would say a decade ago or so women s rights movements were pressuring so that we enacted specific laws to avoid men abusing women and i think those laws were great because there were a lot of men abusing women but now some of the same people are trying to backtrack on that and actually trying to make new laws allowing men to abuse women in sports remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april so actually that doesn t make sense remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april you do it in sports remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april it doesn t make sense it s crazy remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting

donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april and you say to yourself why what are they doing right what are they doing but your country is not too big in that remarks

meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april there s no games remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april no no no it s very good remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april he knows do you have any questions please let s not start with cnn because they re so they re just so wrong yeah please remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april yeah thank you mr president you repeatedly mentioned last night that russia s attack on ukraine was a mistake what is the exact mistake and have you given putin a deadline to actually move toward a ceasefire remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april yeah the mistake was letting the war happen if biden were competent and if zelenskyy were competent and i don t know that he is we had a rough session with this guy over here he just kept asking for more and more that war should have never been allowed to happen that war i went four years and putin wouldn t even bring it up and as soon as the election was rigged and i wasn t here that war started remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april there was no way that war should have been allowed to happen and biden should have stopped and you take a look at putin i m not saying anybody s an angel but i will tell you i went four years and it wasn t even a question he would never and i told him don t do it you re not going to do it and it was the apple of his eye but there was no way that he would have done it all you had to do is lower oil prices remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april if you lowered oil prices biden kept the prices so high because he made it impossible to get it if you lowered oil prices you would have never had the war but you wouldn t have had it with me anyway that war would have never happened and i think it s a great abuse so now what do you you get a country where percent of its land is gone and the best locations where millions of people are killed remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april you know you haven t reported accurately the death and this was biden s war and i m trying to stop it and i think we re going to do a good job i hope we re going to do they lose young people a week on average now they re russians and they re ukrainians but it s we don t care it s like whatever it is remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april it s intolerable remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april they re not from your country they re not from mine but i want to stop it it s a killing field it s like the civil war you take a look i look at the satellite pictures this should not be happening in our time of course our time can be pretty violent as we know but that s a war that should have never been allowed to start remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april and biden could have stopped it and zelenskyy could have stopped it and putin should have never started it everybody s to blame remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april have you spoken to president zelenskyy sir about his offer to purchase more patriot missile batteries remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april i don t know he s always looking to purchase missiles he s against listen when you start a war you ve got to know that you can win the war right you don t start a war against somebody that s times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles if we didn t give them what we gave remember i gave them javelins that s how they won their first big battle with the tanks that got stuck in the mud and they took them out with javelins remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april they have an expression that obama at the time obama gave them sheets and trump gave them javelins but just something that should have never happened it s a really shame the towns are destroyed towns and cities are largely destroyed they have the spires you know the beautiful spires that go up they say that were the most beautiful in the world in ukraine for whatever reason remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april but the most beautiful in the world they re mostly lying on their side shattered and broken and most importantly you have millions of people dead millions of people dead because of three people i would say three people let s say putin number one but let s say biden who had no idea what the hell he was doing number two and zelenskyy and all i can do is try and stop it that s all i want to do i want to stop the killing and i think we re doing well in that regard remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april it should i think you ll have some very good proposals very soon remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april last question sir have you attributed a motive sir have you attributed a motive for the fbi investigation behind the attack on governor josh shapiro over the weekend remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april no i haven t but the attacker was not a fan of trump i understand just from what i read and from what i ve been told the attacker basically wasn t a fan of anybody he s probably just a whack job and certainly a thing like that cannot be allowed to happen remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april crosstalk remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april good relation with president bukele the best guarantee that this time you won t terminate the temporary remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april crosstalk remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april i have a great relationship with this man i have the best relationship with him we ve known each other i ve known him since he was a very young man as i said very very young and i was impressed i said look how this guy is in fact you sort of look like a teenager he looked like a teenager i said what kind of a country is this remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april crosstalk remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april laughter he grew up he grew up well in the last five years remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april do you support the extension for nationals of el salvador and their remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april crosstalk remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april i support him remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april do you plan to remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april i support him go ahead let s hear the question from this very low rated anchor at cnn low rated remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april thank you president trump do you plan to ask president inaudible to help return the man who your administration says was mistakenly deported remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april which one is that remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april the man who was mistakenly deported to el salvador remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april well let me ask pam would you answer that question remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april sir president first and foremost he was illegally in our country he had been illegally in our country and in two courts an immigration court and an appellate immigration court ruled that he was a member of ms and he was illegally in our country right now it was a paperwork it was additional paperwork that needed to be done remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april that s up to el salvador if they want to return him that s not up to us the supreme court ruled president that if as el salvador wants to return him this is international matters foreign affairs if they wanted to return him we would facilitate it meaning provide a plane remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april so will you return him remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april you are doing a great job thank you pam remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april thank you remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april stephen miller wait a minute could you just also respond to that question because it s asked by cnn and they always ask it with a slant because they re totally slanted because they don t know what s happening that s why nobody s watching them but would you answer that question also please remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april yes gladly so as pam mentioned there s an illegal alien from el salvador so with respect to you he s a citizen of el salvador so it s very arrogant even for american media to suggest that we would even tell el salvador how to handle their own citizens as a starting point as to immigration courts found that he was a member of ms when president trump declared ms to be a foreign terrorist organization that meant that he was no longer eligible under federal law which i m sure you know remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april you re very familiar with the ina that he was no longer eligible for any form of immigration relief in the united states so he had a deportation order that was valid which meant that under our law he s not even allowed to be present in the united states and had to be returned because of the foreign terrorist designation remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april this issue was then by a district court judge completely inverted and a district court judge tried to tell the administration that they had to kidnap a citizen of el salvador and fly him back here that issue was raised to the supreme court and the supreme court said the district court order was unlawful and its main components were reversed nine zero unanimously stating clearly that neither secretary of state nor the president could be compelled by anybody to forcibly retrieve a citizen of el salvador from el salvador who again is a member of ms which as i m sure you understand rapes little girls murders women murders children is engaged in the most barbaric activities in the world remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april and i can promise you if he was your neighbor you would move right away remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april so you don t plan to inaudible remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april and what was the ruling in the supreme court steve was it nine to nothing remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april yes it was a nine to zero remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april in our favor remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april in our favor against the district court ruling saying that no district court has the power to compel the foreign policy function of the united states as pam said the ruling solely stated that if this individual at el salvador s sole discretion was sent back to our country that we could deport him a second time remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april no version of this legally ends up with him ever living here because he is a citizen of el salvador that is the president of el salvador your questions about it for the court can only be directed to him remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april i ask the president on this can president bukele weigh in on this do you plan to return him remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april well i m inaudible not suggesting that i smuggle a terrorist into the united states right i mean how can i smuggle how can i return him to the united states like i smuggle him into the united states or what do i do of course i m not going to do it it s like i mean the question is preposterous remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april how can i smuggle a terrorist into the united states i don t have the power to return him to the united states remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april but you could release him inside el salvador remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april yeah but i m not releasing i mean we re not very fond of releasing terrorists into our country we just turned the murder capital of the world into the safest country in the western hemisphere and you want us to go back into releasing criminals so we can go back to being the murder capital of the world no that s not going to happen remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april well they d love to have a criminal released into our country remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april yeah i mean there s a fascination remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april they would love it remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april yeah remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april these are sick people marco do you have something to say about remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april yeah i mean stephen outlined it i don t understand what the confusion is this individual is a citizen of el salvador he was illegally in the united states and was returned to his country that s where you deport people back to their country of origin except for venezuela that was refusing to take people back or places like that remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april i can tell you this mr president the foreign policy of the united states is conducted by the president of the united states not by a court and no court in the united states has a right to conduct the foreign policy of the united states it s that simple end of story remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april but more specifically remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april and that s what the supreme court held by the way to marco s point the supreme court said exactly what marco said that no court has the authority to compel the foreign policy of the united states we won a case nine zero and people like cnn are portraying it as a loss as usual because they want foreign terrorists in the country who kidnap women and children remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april but president trump his policy is foreign terrorists that are here illegally get expelled from the country which by the way is a issue remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april well mr president you said that if the supreme court said someone needed to be returned that you would abide by that you said that on air force one just a few days ago remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april how long do we have to answer this question from you why don t you just say isn t it wonderful that we re keeping criminals out of our country why can t you just say that why do you go over and over and that s why nobody watches you anymore you have no credibility please go ahead remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april president trump thank you so much how many illegal criminals are you planning on exporting to el salvador and president bukele how many are you willing to take from us remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april as many as possible and i just asked the president it s this massive complex that he built jail complex i said can you build some more of them please as many as we can get out of our country that were allowed in here by incompetent joe biden through open borders open borders you probably hear open borders and you can t even understand it because nobody can understand remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april nobody smart or with common sense can understand it so we have millions of people that should not be in this country that are dangerous not just people because we have people but we have millions of people that are murderers drug dealers they ve been allowed to come into our country by other countries that were very smart remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april when they heard that this very low iq president and by the way i took my cognitive exam as part of my physical exam and i got the highest mark and one of the doctors said sir i ve never seen anybody get that kind of that was the highest mark i hope you re happy with that although they haven t been bugging me too much to take a cognitive remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april but i did do my physical and it was released i hope you re all happy with it i noticed there s no questions so probably you are but the cognitive they said to me sir would you like to take a cognitive test i said did biden take one no did anybody take one no not too many people took them i said what about obama did he take one remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april no he didn t take one either i said let me be the only one to take one but i ve actually taken them three times already i like taking them because they re not too tough for me to take but we had a great physical exam so i know you re going to ask that and the doctors who are total professionals walter reed medical center they re great great people remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april and i visited a soldier that was badly wounded incredible soldier lost his leg and we spent a lot of time with him i mean great with his mother and it was really a very great thing they do a phenomenal job i just want to say walter reed i was there for what five or six hours you were there with me but i took a full physical and it came out perfecto so that s good remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april that means you ve got me for a little longer remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april would the united states be willing to pay for those facilities to be open if inaudible remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april i d do something we d help them out yeah we d help them out they re great facilities very strong facilities and they don t play games i d like to go a step further i mean i said it to pam i don t know what the laws are we always have to obey the laws but we also have homegrown criminals that push people into subways that hit elderly ladies on the back of the head with a baseball bat when they re not looking that are absolute monsters remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april i d like to include them in the group of people to get them out of the country but you ll have to be looking at the laws on that steve ok remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april inaudible and do you think more presidents should follow suit like you guys as far as taking a hard stance on crime here in the united states remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april well i do i think everybody has to i mean the president said it better than anybody he said you have liberty and you have to have liberty but to have liberty not everybody is going to be good and some are bad because they re sick they re mentally deranged they re bad and you have to take them if you re going to have a country you re going to have to take those people out and we ve been doing that remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april but this was an unforced error they would call it where we had people that may hate our country or maybe they re just stupid people i think they re probably stupid people more so a lot of people said they did it for the vote but i did better with hispanic people than they did because they always used hispanic remarks donald trump holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april i did better your people love me i saw my poll numbers in your country i m through the roof right percent no no they they some people think they do it for the vote but they don t have to do it for the vote they cheat you know they re professional cheaters that s about the only thing

bukele of el salvador april pharmaceuticals we re going to do we have we don t make our own drugs our own pharmaceuticals we don t make our own drugs anymore the drug companies are in ireland and they re in lots of other places china and all i have to do is impose a tariff the more the faster they move in the higher the tariff it s very inaudible it s inversely proportional remarks donald trump

holds a bilateral meeting with nayib bukele of el salvador april and the auto workers and the teamsters and all of the unions not traditionally republican but i m winning those unions by we re up

Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 How you doing?
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 Hi, sir.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 So I think most of you have seen, they released my physical. They did took the physical on Friday, and I understand it was a very good report. The numbers were perfect. And I took a cognitive exam and I would challenge anybody here to meet those marks because I have a perfect mark. Were you impressed by that?
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 I am impressed and I'm not gonna take that test.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 But you're not that surprised, right?
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 [Laughs] I'm not surprised at all.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 Uh, you aren't. That's good. 'Cause I, I'm not in respect for you as a reporter. Uh, did you have any questions?
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 Yes, sir. Could give us a --
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 You always have.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 I always have question. What is your message to markets tomorrow? There's some ambiguity or at least some, some questions about whether there were exceptions or exceptions --
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 Well, there shouldn't be. There shouldn't be ambiguity. Uh, we have a tremendous country. We have a country that's much richer today than it was a few months ago. We have a financial system that's very respected and, uh, we're gonna do great. And we were taken advantage of and ripped off by every country all over the world, almost, just about.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 They laughed at us and we were run by foolish people and they took advantage of our country and we're just not gonna let that happen anymore.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 In terms of the, uh --
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 Who else?
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 -- the big beautiful bill --
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 Right.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 -- when do you expect that to get done? What would want --
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 Well, I hope soon the big beautiful bill and it's, uh, the big beautiful tax cuts really, and regulation cuts and many other things. Uh, it passed its first test, as you know, the, the last couple of weeks, but particularly during last week where we had a vote. We won in the house, we won in the senate and, uh, that was a big chunk of it. And now they're gonna eventually take, pretty soon, a final vote.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 And the big beautiful tax cuts and regulation cuts and all of the other things that are included in there will go into effect. And I think it'll be probably the largest tax cuts in the history of our country, the most comprehensive regulation cuts in the history of our country and many, many other things, including border wall money.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 Uh, we built 571 miles of wall, but now we can add to it. Uh, as you know, we, we've just concluded a period of time where the border was the most secure it's been in the history of our country. We're very proud of the, the, the other week, couple of weeks ago, or last week actually, five people came in, five, and under Biden it was 500,000 people came in. What they've done to our country should never be forgotten, never be forgotten what they've done and that the news hasn't reported it correctly is a disgrace.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 But what they've done to our country to allow these millions and millions of people in from prisons and mental institutions, insane asylums should never be forgotten. [Inaudible] we're gonna be living with that for a long time. This is tremendous work, tremendous effort. It's one thing they caused massive inflation, they caused a lot of problems, but what they've done to our border, to our country, you should never forget that.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 And you should never, as journalists, allow people to forget it. Yeah?
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 Mr. President, can you talk a little bit about the semiconductor tariff --
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 Yeah.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 -- that you posted on Truth Social today? What is the timeline for that? And I believe it was Jamieson Greer said today that those will not be negotiable.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 Well --
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 Once those tariffs are in place, they are non-negotiable. Is that right?
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 That's right. But the tariffs will be in place, uh, in the not distant future because, as you know, like we did with steel, like we did with automobiles, like we did with aluminum, which are now fully on, we'll be doing that with semiconductors, with, uh, chips and numerous other things. And, uh, that'll take place in the very near future.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 And, and all the things --
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 And what we did is we wanna uncomplicate it from a lot of companies because that's really where it should be, ideally. And we wanted to uncomplicate it from a lot of other companies 'cause we wanna make our chips and semiconductors and other things in our country. And I will tell you, another one is pharmaceuticals, drugs and pharmaceuticals.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 We wanna make our drugs in this country and by, uh, placing a tariff on the companies that are not in this country, they're gonna move into our country and we're gonna have our drugs made in the United States. So that in case of war, in case of whatever, we're not relying on China and various other countries to supply us with drugs, which is not a good idea.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 And it'll happen very fast. It'll all happen very fast. Yeah?
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 Do you know [Inaudible] read the, the semiconductor tariff --
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 I, I'm gonna be announcing it over the next week.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 Can you confirm reports that the Social Security Administration has classified thousands of immigrants as dead even though they're still all living?
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 That's what I hear. I mean, that's what has been reported to me. Uh, dead and, uh, also very inaccurately. And from the standpoint of Social Security, it's a horrible thing. From the standpoint of the, uh, strength of Social Security, when you take dead people out and all of the people that they're talking about, uh, that should not be in there, it's gonna make our system much stronger.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 We're making Social Security stronger. The Democrats are destroying Social Security. Medicare and Medicaid also.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 Yeah, so do you have a reaction to Russia's Palm Sunday attack on Ukraine?
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 Oh, I think it was terrible, and I was told they made a mistake. Uh, but I think it's a horrible thing. I think the whole war's a horrible thing. I think the war is -- For that war to have started is an abuse of power. This country would've never allowed that war to have started if I were president. That war is a shame.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 Millions of people are dead that should be alive. Cities are being destroyed all over Ukraine. The whole culture is gone. It's -- Or very, certainly very severely hurt. You know, the, uh, the chapels, the churches, the, uh, spirals, all of the things that they had in Ukraine were among the most beautiful anywhere in the world.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 And most have been knocked down and blown up into a million pieces. But most importantly, you have millions of people dead that shouldn't be dead. Think of it. Think of what a rigged election means. We would've had absolutely -- We wouldn't have had the war in Ukraine. We wouldn't have had the Russia Ukraine situation.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 We wouldn't have had October 7th, Israel, the Middle East. We wouldn't have inflation. We wouldn't have had the most embarrassing day or a period in the history of our country. That's Afghanistan. One of the most embarrassing moments in the history of our country, in Afghanistan. All of these things wouldn't have taken place.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 Think of it, we wouldn't have had inflation. But millions of people would be alive except for the fact that the election were rigged because that war would've never started and Putin never would've started that war. Okay, any other question?
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 [Crosstalk] Would you say they made a mistake in the attack? You said they made a m- -- you t- -- were told they made a mistake.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 They, they made --
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 Do you mean it was unintentional?
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 They made a mistake. I believe it was -- Look, you're gonna ask them. This is Biden's war. This is not my war. I've been here for a very short period of time. This is a war that was under Biden. He gave them billions and billions of dollars. He should have, uh, never allowed. If he w- -- if he had any brain, which he didn't have and doesn't have, and now it's been proven, uh, he wouldn't have allowed that water to start.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 I would've absolutely not -- That war would never have taken place. But remember this. This is Biden's war. I'm just trying to get it stopped so that we can save a lot of lives. They happen to be Ukrainian and Russian lives, but all I wanna do is get it stopped.

Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 -- the reasons why?
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 -- it's a deeply seated war. And again, it's a war that people didn't expect would start. And in my, in my administration, there was no chance that it would start. And it didn't, by the way. You know, I went four years and it didn't start. People say, ""Oh, well how do you know?"" Well, I know because I went four years and it didn't start.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 You would've never had that war. It would've never started. Putin never would've start -- started it. I mean, I think frankly he had so little respect for Biden, that he started it for that reason, and obviously he didn't get along very well with, uh, Zelensky or anybody else. And, uh, now you have millions of dead people.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 And those people, every one of them, should be alive right now.

Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 I'd very much like if you, look, automobiles, again, automobiles, we have a tariff. Nobody's complaining about it. It went through the process, we have the tariff. Uh, steel, aluminum and some other things, so -- And by the way, our country is taking in billions and billions of dollars on those tariffs. Billions of dollars.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 And maybe, almost as importantly, or maybe more importantly, automobile companies, steel companies, steel companies and factories, and aluminum companies and factories are opening up in our country. But we're taking in billions of dollars on just those three categories.
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 Speaking of steel, can you talk about your conversations with Nippon Steel and what --
Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters On Board Air Force One (PBI-ADW) - April 13, 2025 Yeah, we're talking about different things, but we think that, I think that, the United States Steel, uh, one of the great companies of the world, U- -- U.S. Steel, should, uh, remain in our country. I feel that, I felt that for a long time this was one of the greatest company, companies in the world. For a period of time, for a long period of time, it was the single greatest company in America and I just don't think a foreign company should control it.

the big beautiful bill and it s uh the big beautiful tax cuts really and regulation cuts and many other things uh it passed its first test as you know the the last couple of weeks but particularly during last week where we had a vote we won in the house we won in the senate and uh that was a big chunk of it and now they re gonna eventually take pretty soon a final vote press gaggle donald trump speaks to reporters on board air force one pbi adw april and the big beautiful tax cuts and regulation cuts and all of the other things that are included in there will go into effect and i think it ll be probably the largest tax cuts in the history of our country the most comprehensive regulation cuts in the history of our country and many many other things including border wall money press gaggle donald trump speaks to reporters on board air force one pbi adw april uh we built miles of wall but now we can add to it uh as you know we we ve just concluded a period of time where the border was the most secure it s been in the history of our country we re very proud of the the the other week couple of weeks ago or last week actually five people came in five and under biden it was people came in what they ve done to our country should never be forgotten never be forgotten what they ve done and that the news hasn t reported it correctly is a disgrace press gaggle donald trump speaks to reporters on board air force one pbi adw april but what they ve done to our country to allow these millions and millions of people in from prisons and mental institutions insane asylums should never be forgotten inaudible we re gonna be living with that for a long time this is tremendous work tremendous effort it s one thing they caused massive inflation they caused a lot of problems but what they ve done to our border to our country you should never forget that press gaggle donald trump speaks to reporters on board air force one pbi adw april and you should never as journalists allow

trump speaks to reporters on board air force one pbi adw april yeah press gaggle donald trump speaks to reporters on board air force one pbi adw april that you posted on truth social today what is the timeline for that and i believe it was jamieson greer said today that those will not be negotiable press gaggle donald trump speaks to reporters on board air force one pbi adw april well press gaggle donald trump speaks to reporters on board air force one pbi adw april once those tariffs are in place they are non negotiable is that right press gaggle donald trump speaks to reporters on board air force one pbi adw april that s right but the tariffs will be in place uh in the not distant future because as you know like we did with steel like we did with automobiles like we did with aluminum which are now fully on we ll be doing that with semiconductors with uh chips and numerous other things and uh that ll take place in the very near future press gaggle donald trump speaks to reporters on board air force one pbi adw april and and all the things press gaggle donald trump speaks to reporters on board air force one pbi adw april and what we did is we wanna uncomplicate it from a lot of companies because that s really where it should be ideally and we wanted to uncomplicate it from a lot of other companies cause we wanna make our chips and semiconductors and other things in our country and i will tell you another one is pharmaceuticals drugs and pharmaceuticals press gaggle donald trump speaks to reporters on board air force one pbi adw april we wanna make our drugs in this country and by uh placing a tariff on the companies that are not in this country they re gonna move into our country and we re gonna have our drugs made in the united states so that in case of war in case of whatever we re not relying on china and various other countries to supply us with drugs which is not a good idea press gaggle donald trump speaks to reporters on board air force one pbi adw april and it ll happen very fast it ll all happen very fast yeah press gaggle donald trump speaks to reporters on board air force one pbi adw april do you know inaudible read the the semiconductor tariff press gaggle donald trump speaks to reporters on board air force one pbi adw april i i m gonna be announcing it over the next week press gaggle donald trump speaks to reporters on board air force one pbi adw april can you confirm reports that the social security administration has classified thousands of immigrants as dead even though they re still all living press gaggle donald trump speaks to reporters on board air force one pbi adw april that s what i hear i mean that s what has been reported to me uh dead and uh also very inaccurately and from the standpoint of social security

make our system much stronger press gaggle donald trump speaks to reporters on board air force one pbi adw april we re making social security stronger the democrats are destroying social security medicare and medicaid also press gaggle donald trump speaks to reporters on board air force one pbi adw april yeah so do you have a reaction to russia s palm sunday attack on ukraine press gaggle donald trump speaks to reporters on board air force one pbi adw april oh i think it was terrible and i was told they made a mistake uh but i think it s a horrible thing i think the whole war s a

donald trump speaks to reporters on board air force one pbi adw april millions of people are dead that should be alive cities are being destroyed all over ukraine the whole culture is gone it s or

You know, in theory, the one that wins the presidency does not do well in the midterms but I think this is going to be a change. We're at a level--I don't think we've been at this level maybe ever as the republican party. We're a bigger, better, stronger party than ever before, more people in our party than ever before.

We're going to use it. And we're going to make America great again by using it, so it's going to be something.

We won 85 percent of all of the counties in America. That means that map was red. Did you ever see the map? Did you see the certified map? Where is it? I want to see a certified map.

And incredibly, for the first time ever, all 50 states shifted toward the republican party. It's never happened before. So it was indeed too big to rig. We won the largest number of African American votes in Republican history by far.

Hispanic Americans, we love you, the energy, the brilliance of Hispanic Americans. We want all of the cities and towns along the Texas border. Whereas before Iran, we won none. We never used to win any. I got a call from our great governor of Texas who said, President, you just won every single town along the Texas border to Mexico.

He said, it hasn't happened since reconstruction. I said, define reconstruction for me. He said, that means essentially the Civil War. That's a long time.

It's about common sense, right? It's all about common sense. Over the past month, we've confirmed an all-star team of warriors, patriots, visionaries and put the America First agenda into action.

Bill O'Reilly, he's all right. You know who he said second was, George Washington. That's not bad. I beat George Washington. I love beating George Washington. Thank you, Bill. On our first day in office, we declared a national emergency at our southern border after years of politicians using our military to defend foreign borders while leaving our country defenseless and helpless.

This was an invasion. You know, we had a great first term, a really great first term. And I called it an invasion and we had great numbers, but now we have the best numbers we've ever had. We've never had numbers like this.

It was meant for the children of slaves. Because when it was done many, many years ago, it was during a very tough period in this country's history. And that was meant for the children of slaves. I wish people would understand that, so they could get this thing approved and we don't have millions and millions of people coming into our country and they shouldn't be here.

They're pouring into our country, pouring in. If I weren't elected president, there'd be nobody in Haiti anymore.

And they were coming in from prisons and mental institutions and insane asylums, jails and gang members.

Even during the campaign, you'd have to say Kamala. It's strange, a little different name. Kamala, because the last name was Harris. I used to say, Senator Harris, nobody knew who the hell I was talking about. So I had to go, Kamala. But think of it, I was beating Joe badly, really badly and they changed him.

Do you ever notice that? We're the first at everything. So we beat two candidates. They said, who did you run against? Well, we ran against Biden and we ran against Kamala Harris. But illegal border crossings now have plummeted by almost 100 percent. The border czar never called the border, never called the great people of the border.

They hated me, but then they became to love me. You know why? Because the border people want to have great borders, but you have to call them on occasion. How are we doing today? Pete, how are we doing? You have to call. And we called the right guys.

They were great. They all endorsed us. With the police, we got high 90s in terms of--and many of them were unionized.

I said, you know why I did that, because unions like her and labor likes her and a lot of people like her and she's very solid, very strong and she's going to do the right thing. But they all voted for us. They didn't vote for me. They voted for us. We got the teamsters, we got the firefighters, we got the police, we got the auto workers.

We had tremendous support. So I think it's nice to give them a person in the center, because that's what she is. She's going to be very good, I think. But a lot of people say, why did you do that? I said, because I want to do something nice for these people that voted for me. Oh, gee, what a great political move that was.

No, it's all common sense, remember that? Remember that. Sean O'Brien was fantastic. The whole group, they were great. Over the past few weeks, we've begun the largest deportation operation in American history, larger even than that of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a very moderate man, but he was very strong on that.

I'll tell you, I had four years, I don't know if you had this, I couldn't stand it. Don't get angry. Donald, don't get angry, please.

To crush inflation by slashing spending, I imposed an immediate federal hiring freeze, a federal regulation freeze and a foreign aid freeze. We're giving to countries that hate us.

/Users/samantha/Desktop/speech text data/rollcall (1).csv,"Wow. Thank you very much. This is a great room. And uh, you know, we've done very well in this room before, but right now, we broke every record. I just heard from Mike Johnson, he said, we broke every record, sir. There is over $35 million. That's not bad for an evening. For an evening, that's not bad. I wonder if you ever turned the room this way.
You know, it's interesting because I love real estate. I love ballrooms. They have nice ballrooms, a lot of them. I wonder if they ever turned it this way instead. So it might be interesting. This way, I'm not talking to a wall. They think they get a better view, but actually, I'm not sure. But next time maybe we won't have to worry about that next year.
Well, we'll do $45 or $50 million, right? I mean, a lot of people you broke your record attendance. And you broke your money record. And that's a great tribute to the Republicans and the party and everything it stands for. And it's wonderful. And I want to thank especially speaker, Mike Johnson, because he's been incredible.
And we have some unbelievable supporters of our House Republican majority with us, as you know. And with the help of everyone in this room, the next year's Republican Party is going to defy history. We're going to really defy it. And we already are. We're getting things done. It's going to be very interesting to see.
This is going to be a very interesting year. We have an interesting time. We're making a fortune with tariffs. $2 billion a day. Do you believe it? I was told $2 billion a day. You know, I got hit by the press about tariffs. We're making $2 billion, billion. This isn't $35 million. That's peanuts. $2 billion a day.
And then they say, gee, they don't know. You know, this is only the enemy can be talking this way. In addition, we have a lot of countries coming to see us, they want to make a deal. And we're doing -- we're doing things that nobody's ever even thought about doing. And we're going to defeat the radical left Democrats who are out there complaining about everything.
All they do is complain and then they want to put men in women's sports and things like that. They want men in women's sports. They're still fighting for that. I saw this poor guy. You all know him. I won't mention his name. He's sort of a nice guy. He's a loser. He's a Democrat, but he's a loser. And he was fighting on a big show this morning.
We've got to have that. It's not fair that -- essentially that men aren't allowed to compete against women. Can you believe this guy? But uh, let them do it. I say we shouldn't be fighting a lot of these things. Just let them go. And then just before the next election, we'll unleash on them. Because this -- it would be very sad if they actually changed their policies.
We don't want that to happen. But we're going to win the midterm elections, and we're going to have a tremendous thundering landslide. I really believe that. And it's so important that we pass the big, beautiful bill because that's going to be -- And I really think -- and I really think we're helped a lot by the tariff situation that's going on, which is a good situation, not a bad.
It's great. It's going to be legendary, you watch. Legendary in a positive way, I have to say. Uh, it's going to be legendary, but I really think it actually puts pressure on those few Republicans that just can't get there. Do you know what the alternative is? A Democrat bill or a chapter for the country.
You know, we have the debt continuation. And they have to do -- they have to do this. They have to get there. And I think we are there. We had a great meeting today. I think we are there. But just in case there are a couple of Republicans out there, you just got to get there. Close your eyes and get there.
It's a phenomenal bill. Stop grandstanding. Just stop grandstanding. Boy, oh boy, oh boy. You know their policy, the Democrats is horrible, it's horrible. Think of it, open borders, just all of the horrible, stupid things they have. You don't have energy. You don't have anything. They've lost their confidence.
Everything is bad. But the one thing they always vote in unison, you don't see somebody that's holding up, I'm going to hold up and the alternative is -- is hell. You know, the alternative is hell, so the Republicans just have -- one little thing the Republican Party has to do is get together and damn vote.
If you're a single guy or a second guy, you fight like hell for what you get. And then in the end you have to vote because the policy is phenomenal. You know, they don't get every little ounce. It doesn't work that way. And this -- uh, this bill that we're working on now is the best I think we've ever passed.
Uh, Mike, wherever you may be, it's the best. I think it's the best thing we've -- we'll get it passed. But I think it's going to be the most important thing we've ever passed. It's the best thing we've ever passed. And I do think that the war with the world, which is not a war at all because they're all coming here, Japan is coming here as we speak.
They're in a plane flying, lots of them. All tough negotiators. But things that people wouldn't have given us two years ago wouldn't have even thought of it two years ago, three years ago, five years ago, seven, they're giving us everything. They don't want tariffs on themselves. And it's very simple. We're making deals.
And people are paying tariffs. Countries are paying tariffs. Right now, China is paying a 104 percent tariff. Think of it, 104 percent. Now it sounds ridiculous, but they charged us for many items 100 percent, 125 percent. Many countries have. They've ripped us off left and right. But now it's our turn to do the ripping.
That's OK. We're going to make our country even stronger, stronger than it ever was. In 2026, Republicans will fight for every state, every seat and every single vote. We're going to fight like hell. I intend to personally campaign for candidates all across the country. And we just won't -- You're right about that.
We won't just keep our majorities. We want to expand our majorities by a lot. You know, there's this thing about midterm elections that you have a president and the president -- they never seem to win. I don't understand. They never seem to win the midterm elections. And I have no idea why. You know, we're not going to let that be a self-fulfilling prophecy.
I have no idea why. We're setting records right now. We're getting more things approved than any president has ever done in the first 100 days. It's not even close. I had somebody say the most successful month -- first month in the history. Now they said the most successful 100 days in the history of our country.
And I believe that's right. And we're going to continue that way, if not more so. And we're going to do tremendously in midterms. There's no reason, we should do great in the midterms. There's this thing that for some reason, the president, whoever the president is the midterms are tough. Why would they be tough?
If we're doing great, they should be easy. And I'm telling you. We're going to -- we got to win a lot more. But as Mike said before, I happen to listen to him, he was on C- SPAN 1. That's a big upgrade, right? I was listening as I was putting on the tie, how does it look? He was on C- SPAN 1, and we -- and they were talking about that.
And I thought to myself, because people love him and they love your leaders, they love really the party is just doing well. A couple we could do without to be honest with you, but -- but the party is doing well. And there's no reason we shouldn't just get together and win these midterms. And win them by a lot.
Because seven that I heard Mike talking about before. And seven is not really enough. But we lived for one for a period of time. You know, the only thing good about seven when you have one and now all of a sudden you have seven, it sounds like it's like a landslide. It's so good. It's like, uh, the most amazing thing.
Seven sounds so good when I hear that. It sounds like we can't be beaten. And uh, we should be 50, 60 up. Honestly, we should be 100 up. Because based on policy, these people have the worst policy that anybody has ever seen. There's something wrong with them. Honestly, there's something wrong with them. All this crap. 13 House Democrats currently represent districts that voted for Trump and voted for Trump big.
And in 2026, we're going to tell them, all 13, that you're fired. Get out, out. Get out. There's no reason for that, 13. But 13 is a small number compared to some of these stats. Uh, we are going to work very hard. I'm going to do tele rallies. You know tele rallies. I'll do rallies for a lot of you, but I'll do tele rallies at a minimum.
And we just had two great elections, by the way. And I heard everybody is introducing our two new Congress -- where are they, please, stand up? I want to look you in the eye. I want to look you in the eye, Randi. I'm looking at the two of them. Where's -- what a job you did, man, huh? You were never in doubt.
Where the hell -- where is our second person here? I know he's -- oh, there, he is. Boy, they gave him a lousy seat. He's behind. Good, great job. We're proud of you, man. Great job. Great job. Thank you. And you know, those -- both elections, they were saying it's going to be close. It's going to be close.
And I was listening. And they won by like -- you won by what, 17 points, 18 points? I don't think that's close. I don't think it's close. So we won by 15 and 18 points. And they're saying it was a terrible evening for Trump. Can you believe it? Terrible evening. They only won by 18 points and 15 points. Anyway, good job both of you.
Good job. But in addition to our fantastic House speaker, we're pleased to be joined by Majority Leader Steve Scalise. And I watched you, too, Steve. I watched you on C- SPAN 1. And Steve has suffered greatly. I mean, I was there the night that it looked like he wasn't going to make it. He's very brave. He suffered greatly.
And I tell the story about the baseball game where, I mean, he was really -- the doctor told me, sir, I've never had anybody lose so much blood. It's not looking good. And his wife loved him. She was such a disaster that night. She was crying. She was crying. Because I've been with people that were in serious trouble and their wives couldn't care.
They couldn't care less. In fact, after they recovered, I said, do yourself a favor, get rid of the wife. She said -- No, I'm only kidding, of course. I'm only kidding. I like to say I'm only kidding that way that cleans it up a little bit for the -- for the press. I say I was only kidding. No, I've seen some wives that were truly not bothered too much.
I had one where the dog died and the husband died on the same day. And I said it's too bad about Harry. No, no, but Lucy died. Lucy, oh my God. Harry didn't mean -- he left her a fortune, too. Can you believe it? Harry didn't matter. The dog mattered a lot. But I -- I was with Steve. And he was really, you know, that was a tough thing.
And then, amazingly, he was like a year later he was in the baseball game against the Democrats. And he was playing second base. And he was having a hard time. You know, it's a hard time getting around. And with his luck, a shot was hit to him on the ground, a ground ball. And he got down. And that ball was -- no way that ball was -- it was right at him, but really it was whacked.
I don't know who the hell hit. It looked like a major league ground ball. And Steve went down and blocked that sucker. And got on his knees and threw it to first base. It was the most unbelievable thing that it could happen. This was God watching. This was God watching a game. I'm telling you. Does everybody remember that?
He blocked it or knocked the hell out of his foot, not his glove. It was his foot. And he got down and grabbed the ball, threw it out and got the runner by quite a bit. And uh, they then took him out of the game. And I said what a great move. That was a good manager. They took him out of the game because you can't improve on that.
Let me tell you. But he -- he had great courage. And amazing how he's done. And he's been very special. And all of us know it. He's really done great. Another man I've really gotten to know a lot and I think he's fantastic is Tom Emmer, the majority whip. I think he's fantastic. Where's Tom? Where's Tom?
Where is our Tom?
Right here.
Because I want to see his wife. You know, his wife is better than him. She -- he admits it.
Right here.
Oh, that's good. Hi, Tom. So where is she, Tom? Oh no. She's not -- she's home. She's watching C-SPAN. Yeah, I know. Thank you, Tom. Great job you do. And Lisa, you were up talking about Donald Trump tonight. And Lisa McClain conference chair. She was talking about Trump. And I appreciate it, Lisa. Lisa, where are you?
Lisa?
Over here.
Just like a roast. Thank you, darling. I saw your whole speech. I watched you and Steve and Mike. I watched the whole thing. Then they said, sir, we have to leave. You're going to be late. I said, I want to watch these speeches. And we have Richard Hudson, the NRCC chairman, who set the record tonight. Richard, great going.
That's a great -- that's a great job. And uh, Brian Jack, who was with me from day one of my political career. He was so fantastic. He was so fantastic. And he came to me, he said, do you think it would be OK? He wanted to run for Congress, he always wanted to run for Congress. It was the most important thing, but he was with me, knows so much about politics and boxing.
He knows a lot about boxing, too, but he loves politics. But he really just wanted to run. I think his ambition was to be a congressman. And the seat came due, a good member of Congress actually retired. And Brian -- in Georgia, and Brian said uh, what do you think, sir? I said, well, you got my endorsement.
And he won by a lot. And he's never looked back. He's a fantastic guy and a great political leader, a great politician. Brian Jack. Where are you, Brian? Where are you, Brian? Hi, Brian. Great job. I'm proud of you, Brian. And more than 160 members of Congress, and I'd like to really -- you've done incredibly well.
They're really looking back. And you know, I said before the Democrats have taken a lot of beatings. They have lost their confidence. They've gone crazy, they've gone crazy. How about this new one they have, their new star, Crockett, how about her? Is she -- is that real? Are they serious about that? That's their new star?
If that's their new star, they're in serious trouble. I mean, this is Crockett. Oh, man, oh, man. But we have -- uh, we've done a job, but they've totally lost their confidence. And it's a hard thing when you lose your confidence, but they have. They've taken a lot of beatings. And now they're going to rely on Crockett to bring them back.
Crockett is going to bring them back. You ever watch this? Last November, all the leaders here tonight were given a mandate from the American people. And at the presidential level, we won, think of this, all seven swing states. We won the Electoral College 312 to 2 26. That's not bad. Remember? The fake news was saying it's going to be tough because people like Trump, but he should be able to get 270. I actually went to Nebraska and campaigned for one vote.
I went to New Hampshire. I campaigned. Because they said that it could be where a 270, 269. So I'm going to all the places and I'm trying to get one. We won Nebraska big. But there was one area, and I went there. I went all over the place campaigning. And then we get 312. But we won in a landslide too because we won the popular vote for the first time of a Republican in decades.
And now I think that's going to be done routinely. We won 85 percent of all counties in America, 525 for them and 2725 for us. That's that map that you see. It's all red except for the two corners. They have a little blue, a little line of blue. For the first time in history, all 50 states shifted toward the Republican Party.
First time in history, it's never happened. It's a shift. It's shifted republican. And today, there are more registered Republicans than at any time in the history of our country. How good -- how about that? Meanwhile, approval ratings for the Democrat Party have plunged to the lowest level ever recorded.
They're at 26 percent. So you tell me about the midterms, right? 26, the lowest level ever for either party. The Republican Party is a much bigger party now than it was ever before. And I must say that it's the biggest now since you heard the name Donald J Trump running as a politician. You heard the name before, but not as a politician.
I said to my wife, ""You know, I think I'm going to do this thing. Do I have your approval?"" ""Yes, darling, I think you'll win."" See, she's a supportive first lady. I don't know if she believed it or not, but she said it. She said ""yes, darling, I think you'll win."" How do you think I'll do? Oh, darling, you'll win very easily.
Even though I've never done it before. I said I have one problem. I've never done it before. She said, ""that doesn't matter. You're so talented."" I said, ""thank you very much."" This is why we get along. It's easy to get along like that. But we have far more people and far more enthusiasm than the parties ever had.
I think I could almost say than any party has ever had. I don't think any party's ever had more enthusiasm than us and spirit. A lot of that's our leadership. The Democrats are a broken party with bad policy. They've lost so much. And uh, look, both as politicians and as people they've lost. The stage is set for a monumental victory for the Republicans in the midterms.
And many of you, I guess most of you so many great congressmen and women here, got some Senators here also. But many of you are -- all of you are up. We've got to -- we've got to win. We've got to work really hard and we've got to win because there's no way they should be winning based on policy. And it's ultimately about policy.
We simply have to keep our promises to the people. And we have to very simply put America first. Put America first. And I said I ran on common sense. You know, I ran on common sense. It sounds like a phrase that would have been used. I don't know, nobody tells me it was used in politics before. Now everybody's used it. I see the Democrats, some Democrat guy who's a real sleazeball, got up. He said, yeah, I ran on common sense.
That's what I did. Common sense. Yeah. And I said, gee, yeah. But the problem in politics, you come up with a little slogan and they copy it. But you know they copied no tax on tips. Remember, I said no tax on tips? Nevada hadn't been won for many years by a Republican. And the state of Nevada, and don't ever call it Nevada, you'll lose 25 percent.
Just call it Nevada. It's true. It seems almost nicer the other way. You know, Nevada sounds like Brooklyn. Doesn't that make sense? I come from Nevada, but don't ever call it Nevada. Call it Nevada. But as you know, the corrupt globalist establishment that ruled our country for decades is now complaining that I'm doing exactly what I pledged to do in the campaign.
All of these things, tariffs, the men in women sports, everything, the borders. Strong borders. We have the strongest border we've ever had. Today, it was just announced. The strongest border. They don't want to write that. You know, they forget. They forget. Eggs. I came in eggs, not a very glamorous thing to talk, but eggs.
I was in for one week and they said egg prices are soaring. I said I've just been here, I didn't know this. Please, I didn't know it. The -- the fake news, they're going egg prices are soaring. And I said, man, I just got here. You know, let me know about it. What's going on with eggs? Tell me. So they gave me a little bit of a thing.
And it's true. Under Biden, they soared like double, triple, quadruple. You couldn't even get them. They were not available. They said don't use eggs for Easter. Use the plastic alternative. Plastic. We got -- at Mar-a-Lago, we've got plastic eggs all over the place. They said don't use it for Easter for -- if you're doing an Easter egg hunt do not use eggs.
Well, we have a wonderful secretary of Agriculture, as you know, Brooke Rollins. She's here someplace, I think. And she got -- she went after it. And when she goes after something, we don't play games. Right, Brooke? And eggs, egg prices are down now 87 percent. And you have all the eggs you want. 87 percent.
And they didn't write about it. They don't talk about it. I go up, I make speeches about eggs all the time. I never get a reporter or writing about it because we were successful. If you're a Republican, when you're successful in something you have to toot your own horn. Talk about it because you're the only one that's going to. It's a pretty rough -- it's a rough business I will tell you.
But the shrill voices that you're hearing this week about tariffs are the same scoundrels and frauds who never thought twice about when the United States lost 90,000 factories and plants. Think of that, 90,000. How do you do 90,000? If you had a map, a big map, the size of that wall and you had a pin for each factory, you wouldn't have enough room.
If you think of it, 90,000 factories since NAFTA, the worst trade deal in history by the way. And we had it terminated. Everybody said you'd never be able to. It had to be terminated by Congress. And it was not easy. It was so bad. You know, the people have a lot of -- it's very interesting, they have a lot of power, they have a lot of political power.
It's hard to get even a bad deal terminated. But we did do it. And we got US -- USMCA and that's -- that's been really great, but when they cheat, it's not so good. And they cheat, they do cheat. You know, I respect Mexico, I respect Canada, but they cheat like hell. You know, Canada charges for our dairy products 270 percent.
Nobody knows that. They charge you two percent for the first two cartons of milk. And after that, you go up to 270. And the press says they've only charged two percent. No, that's for the first two cartons. So it's -- uh, you know, we can't have that. And we have to be wise to it, and get along with everybody, but we have to call people out. 6 million manufacturing jobs were lost since NAFTA when 21 million illegal aliens poured across our borders, think of that, many of whom were violent criminals, murderers, drug lords and the mentally insane.
Insane asylums were closed. They used to go crazy when I talk about Hannibal Lecter, the late, great Hannibal Lecter, right, Silence of the Lambs. The fake news would say, why does he talk about that? He's a fictional character. He's actually not. We have many of them that came across the border. It's actually not.
But when the people went to the voting booth then we understood why he talked about that. Because they voted for us. They said we don't want Hannibal Lecter in our country, the great Hannibal Lecter. He was -- uh, he was a very important force. But the press would go absolutely crazy if I mentioned Hannibal Lecter's name, because they said he's a fictional character.
No, but it was making a point. And the point is they're emptying mental institutions and insane asylum, not anymore they're not, insane asylums into our country. We had, uh, numbers the likes of which nobody's ever seen anything like it. Other countries -- I deal with other countries all the time. I am right now on tariffs where they want to make a deal with us. We don't necessarily want to make a deal with them.
We're happy the way we are taking our $2 billion a day. But they want to make a deal with us. And they talk about it. And they say we cannot believe that they had open borders. These are countries. They have -- you know, they have borders. And they don't let people into their country. They can't understand how -- they did it because they're sick or they're crazy.
There's something really wrong with these people. But the same people now telling me about how to deal with China are the ones who sold out America for decades to China. For decades, they gave up to China. I'm the only one that -- do you how much -- China has paid almost $700 billion in tariffs under me. And then they say Donald Trump hasn't been tough on China.
They say Trump hasn't been tough on Russia. OK, here's the story. Nord Stream 2, did anybody ever hear of it? It's the biggest pipeline in the world. I closed it. Russia had it. And I closed it. Putin told me that's the worst thing. You're supposed to be friendly with me. I'd hate to see you as my enemy.
And I closed Nord Stream 2. When Biden got in, he opened it up immediately. It serviced all of Europe going to Germany. It's service to all of Europe. We closed it. And they say, oh, he wasn't tough on Russia. I was very tough with the sanctions and everything else. And by the way just for your information, we're trying like hell to get the fighting stopped between Russia and Ukraine.
A thing that never would have happened if the election wasn't rigged. We had a rigged election. And we can say it and say it loud and say it proud because the election was rigged. And we can't let that stuff happen anymore. Go to paper ballots. Go to same day voting. Go to voter ID. Go to citizenship. You have to prove your citizenship with little piece of paper.
Then you won't have it. It's sort of disappointing because a lot of Republican governors, they could do that same day voting, paper ballots. Very sophisticated paper, actually. It's all watermarked. You can't cheat. It's very hard to cheat. France went that way. They were like us, and they were, you know, having very bad elections, very crooked elections.
They had 37 million people. They voted. They had a winner. They had a loser. They went home. That was it. 10:00 in the evening it was over. With us, did you ever see, we have these machines that cost a fortune. And they say we think we're going to have the final vote tally in two and a half weeks. And wait a minute, this is Election Day.
Did you ever see where in California they were counting votes four weeks later? And then they say -- and -- and by the way, all paper costs eight percent of the machines. Why is it that Republican governors aren't going to it, OK? What's going on with our Republican governors? If nothing else, you say even if it was just the same and it's not, it's, you know, it's -- nothing's foolproof when it comes to voting, but it's pretty close.
But it costs eight percent. In other words, you can have your election eight percent the cost of the machines and you get an accurate count. So it's pretty amazing. They gave us NAFTA mass illegal immigration, the Democrats did. The fake Paris Climate Accord and the China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
That was a wonderful day for us. China entered the world trade. They've done pretty good. And you know, they didn't do things exactly by the books. And they were a developing nation. They still are. They say we are a developing nation. We should be entitled to more. And our people say, oh, that's right, they're developing.
They're not developing. We're developing. Look at some of our inner cities. We've got to develop them. But uh, we can't let the Democrats get away with this stuff. But we're developing more than they are. The globalists have been wrong about everything. And so I wear their attack on me because nobody has ever been attacked like a man named Donald J. Trump.
In the history of our country, nobody has ever, but I wear it as a badge of honor. Nobody has ever been attacked. I was under more investigations than the late great Al Capone. He was the most violent criminal. He was the most violent mob boss in history. And I was under investigation far more than him. It wasn't even close.
Our opponents are not afraid that our America First policies will fail. They're terrified that our strategy will succeed. And we're going to get bigger and stronger and better as a party. And that's what's happening. And that is what's happening. It's going to be something. And I'm actually looking forward to the midterms.
I really are. We're going to prove that all of their treasonous years of betrayal will not be forgotten. Because it's treason. What they did is treason. When they allowed millions of people to pour in through open borders from all over the world, they came. To me, that's treason. What they've done to our country is unthinkable.
The money we have to spend to take people out. And then we have judges that say no let Tren de Aragua come back into our country. They want -- they want them to come back in. Killers. They cut off a man's fingers because he -- did you cut off -- did you, sir, make a phone call to the police in Colorado? Yes, I did.
I did. You've attack -- you've attacked us, and you've taken over our building. They took over real estate all over Colorado. Uh, you did right? Give me your hand, put the hand down. Boom, cuts off his fingers. And they want him back. And how about the mix up with the MS-13 where it wasn't a Tren de Aragua, it was an MS-13 killer.
And they said, oh, they got it mixed up. Let's get them back into our country. Nah, we got to -- we need people that are going to love our country. I'm proud to be the president for the workers, not the outsourcers. The president who stands up for Main Street, not Wall Street, who protects the middle class, not the political class.
And who defends America, not trade cheaters all over the globe. They're trade cheaters. They cheated on us. They cheated with tariffs on us. They stole our money. They stole our jobs. And now people are going around saying, oh, we're not treating them right now. We're treating them very good, actually. They're lucky, we're treating them so good.
And you know, when I have tariffs and I say, well, we're going to charge what they did. We're going to charge what they did. And then I say I'm going to charge much less than they did. Believe me, we're actually being nice about it. But we're doing very well, better than we've ever done before. My job is not to maximize the profits of outsourcers and foreign -- I mean, these foreign corporations are horrible.
It's horrible what they're doing, but we're catching them. We're catching them by the dozens. My job is to defend the -- I have to defend the American dream, and I have to defend the American citizens. That's my job. I have to defend that. The American dream is never mentioned. It was mentioned for four years and now it's being mentioned again, but it was never mentioned when we had Sleepy Joe in office.
I used to have a big -- the hardest thing I had to do with Joe Biden is the nickname, do I call him Sleepy Joe or Crooked Joe? Could we take a vote, please? Who wants to call him Crooked Joe? Who wants to call him Sleepy Joe? That's my problem. It's like the same. They both work. They both work beautifully.
Joe had one ability that I didn't have. You know, he said he was a good golfer, he's terrible. Somebody said the only time I got angry during our debate when he said he was a six handicap for he's not a six, he's not a 36, OK? But he had one ability that I don't have, he was able to go to a beach, bathing suit in tow, because it looked like it was actually falling off.
But he'd go. He had a hard time walking through the sand because you know, sand is heavy on your feet. Carrying one of those six ounce chairs that are made out of aluminum that if you weigh a little bit too much, it just cracks in the middle when you sit down. And he could sit down in a beach with photographers on the beach, you know, he's the president, so he had a minimum of photographers, but he still had photographers.
And he could fall asleep. Who the hell could do that? Who could fall asleep? And he turned around and drool would be coming out. He didn't care. His wife didn't care. It's an ability that I could never fall asleep under those circumstances. I'd be very conscious of my body and what we look like. I'd be sitting up like this.
And I'd say darling, it's time to go, let's get out of here. Well, would it most people? I mean, this guy could go to the beach, and he was out in seconds. Guys are shooting him. He'd be in the papers the next day, eyes closed, mouth open. The United States has been getting ripped off for 50 years. And we're simply not going to take it anymore.
And that's what's happening right now. In 1950, the United States dominated global auto production producing more than 75 percent of all of the cars on Earth. Think of that, 75 percent, and even higher before that. Today, we produce 11 percent, while China produces three times more than we do. Let me tell you something.
With the tariffs that we're doing, as you know, we have tariffs on automobiles, aluminum, steel, separate from the other tariffs. The baseline, we call it. Companies are pouring back into our country with plants. There's a run on sites. There's a run on old plants. Most of them are being ripped down for new plants.
Uh, they stopped building in Mexico, four or five plants. And they come -- they're all coming into the United States. I know what the hell I'm doing. I know what I'm doing. And you know what I'm doing, too, that's why you vote for me. And the chip makers are coming in. They're all coming in. We've never had anything like this.
We have investment they think of about seven -- think of this, $7 trillion. And that's been in a month and a half. Think of that. For the first -- like, you got to give me a little time to get warmed up with that, so let's take the first couple of weeks off. For about a month and a half we got seven -- almost $7 trillion spoken for.
Trillion. We've never had that. I don't know if we've ever had it at any time, but if you go back and look at Biden and these other campaigns, any of them, they had -- they didn't have those numbers for the year. These are the biggest chip makers in the world, the biggest auto manufacturers in the world, $7 trillion of investment.
And that means jobs. I look at it differently, not investment, I look at it as jobs. And they're coming in at levels that we've never seen before. And it is true that Mexico, they've stopped building plants. And those plants are now going to be built in the United States of America. That's pretty exciting.
All because of two things. They say -- they want to be nice to me. They say, sir, because of November 5th, the election and because of tariffs. I said in that order? And the smart ones say, yes, sir. First was that you got elected, and second, was tariffs. And I'll accept that, you know, but I will tell you because of tariffs.
But I'm the only one that would have done the tariffs because everybody was afraid. They were afraid of being criticized because the globalists will go after you. For seven decades, American ships have patrolled the seas, American troops have kept the pace and peace, and American wealth has enriched the globe.
But despite all we have given to them, you will not find an American car in Berlin, in Tokyo, in Seoul, in Shanghai. Not a car. I used to say to Angela Merkel, Angela, how many Chevrolets do we have in Berlin? Why, none, Donald, none. That's right, Angela. You got it. How many Chevrolets do you think we have in Munich, Angela?
None, Donald. I said you sent us 7 million cars last year, so we're going to start buying American made cars or cars that are manufactured in America. And if you can do it, not part of what I was going to say, but one of the best things that I think I've come up with is interest deductions. If you buy a car that's made in America, you get an interest deduction on the money you borrow.
And I love it. I hope you can do it, Mike. I hope you can do it. Because I haven't bugged you about that. I've been talking about no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime. And I haven't really been as strong on this one, but it's only because it gets a little bit long, you know. Uh, but if you think of it, you buy a car, you borrow money, and you get a deduction on that money if the cars made in America. -- I think that that will not cost you $0.10. You'll make money with that one.
I think you'll make money actually in a certain way with the other three also. I think they're very important and they were a part of our campaign. I was going to say before that in Nevada that when I came up with the no tax on tips, I think that's why we won by a massive amount. And interestingly, they came up about a month and a half later and she was making one of her few speeches.
She didn't speak too much for a reason, a good reason. She was making a speech, and the middle she said, oh, and by the way, we will have -- and everyone's falling asleep. We will have no tax on tips. That place booed the hell out of it. They said you're a little late on that one. Because I was worried they'd copy me. You know, it was so good.
Do you know how it actually happened? Maybe I should tell the story quickly. I was in my building in Las Vegas, we have a great restaurant there. And this young, beautiful waitress -- and you're not allowed to say beautiful because that's the end of your political career. If you call the -- if you call a young woman beautiful, that's the end of your career.
But what the hell, she was beautiful, so she came up to me. And she said, uh, hello, sir. It's so nice to have you at the hotel. I said, thank you. I had a group of people, some political people actually. It was very interesting. And I said how's everything going? She said, oh, it's so tough. They're after my tips.
Who's after them? The government. They're after my tips, constantly after my tips. They're after all of us for the tips. She said, sir, we should have no tax on tips. I said, say it again. What? We should have no tax. She said, this was my consultant, a waitress from my hotel. Most people go out and spend millions of dollars to come up with an idea.
I said she just said no tax on tips. That's the coolest thing I've ever heard. So I went outside. There were a lot of -- we finished our wonderful meal, steak, went outside, and there were a lot of cameras as there always are, unfortunately. I say, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to have a new policy all over the country, but specifically in Nevada, there will be no tax on tips, right?
And the cameras went wild. Click, click, click, click, click. And we won the state by a lot. So I don't know. So I owe -- I have to find that waitress and thank her. She was my consultant. Except I didn't pay her $2 million like the other consultants that we all get screwed by. Even worse than the tariffs, other countries impose are the non-monetary barriers.
That's a non-monetary. These are not financial. These are other things, what they do so that you can't get your product in that country. And China, as you know, is one of the big offenders. And it's not all China. Look, I get along with President Xi. I have over the years, but you know, you just -- uh, when COVID came, that was the end.
That was it. That was called The Bridge Too Far. But I've always had a good relationship with a very smart guy who loves his country. I love our country. So you know, we love our country, he loves his. I tell that to other leaders. You've got to fight for your country. It's -- you're not going to fight for us, but we can't fight for you.
We're fighting for other countries. We're trying to make them great without making us great. But those days are over. They steal our intellectual property. They rob our trade secrets. They manipulate their currency to levels that have never been seen before. Today, it was announced that China is reducing it's currency.
Did you see that? Big, big. In other words, they're going to make up for it. They got every trick in the book. I'll tell you they are great. You got to hand it to them. You got to hand it to them. They -- they're manipulating their currency today as an offset against the tariffs. You're not supposed to do that, the game isn't supposed to be played that way.
It makes it very hard for us. But in the end it -- it's not good because they have to buy oil. See, we don't need oil. We don't need oil and gas. We have more than any other country. They have to buy it. That's where it hurts them. When they do that, it costs them twice as much. And they ship their products through every one of our trading partners, running up our deficits with these countries.
They sell a lot. You know, when you put a tariff on them, they sell it. Like with steel, they were dumping tremendous amounts of steel into our country curing my term. I saved every steel mill, every -- we only have steel mills because of what I did. I put a high tariff on them, 25 and then 50 percent. And it stopped.
It stopped. They were dumping so much steel. We would have lost every single steel mill. The people that like me best are the people in the steel business. But I think the auto business is going to be right there. I think chips are going to be there. I think pharmaceuticals are going to be there. Because you know, we don't make our own pharmaceuticals drugs and other things to get better.
They're made in other countries. And you pay a number -- I mean, the same package in our country compared to like London and other places is sometimes 10 times more. Ten times more. Something that sells for $88 in London sells for $1,300 here. Made in the same factory by the same company. And that's over.
I told them all that's over. They put all of their research and development into it. They put everything. But what they don't tell you is that these other countries are smart. They say you can't charge more than $88, otherwise you can't sell your product. And uh, the -- the drug companies listen to them.
But we're going to do something that we have to do. We're going to put -- we're going to tariff our pharmaceuticals. And once we do that, they're going to come rushing back into our country. Because we're the big market. The advantage we have over everybody is that we're the big market. So we're going to be announcing very shortly a major tariff on pharmaceuticals.
And when you -- And when they hear that, they will leave China, they will leave other places. Because they have to sell. Most of their product is sold here. And they're going to be opening up their plants all over the place in our country. We're going to be announcing that. So that's breaking news. Ladies and gentlemen, we have breaking news.
That's what's going to happen. What other presidents allow China to get away with is absolutely criminal, but I'm not like the other presidents. And it's not going to happen under President Trump. It's just not going to happen. After all of the abuses they've perpetrated, China is attempting to impose additional unjustified tariffs.
Just so you understand, they all got rich because of tariffs. You know, now when we do it, oh, it's so terrible what Trump is doing. It's so terrible. They got rich. And not only China, many countries. I mean, you look at Vietnam, you look at so many, I could name 50 right now. Biden couldn't do that. He couldn't name any.
Name one country? Name any country? What's the name of our country? He doesn't know. That's why additional tariffs on Chinese goods are in place effective midnight tonight at 104 percent. Until they make a deal with us, that's what it's going to be. I think they'll make a deal at some point. China will. They want to make a deal.
They really do. They want to make a deal. They just don't know how to get it started. Because they're proud people. China will now pay a big number to our treasury. This is all taxes. And don't let them keep telling you that this is a tax on our people. I hate that. You know, they say it's a tax. No, often, much of it is paid.
And hey, look what happened during my first term. We had no inflation, and yet I took in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and taxes from China. No other president got $0.10 in tariffs or taxes from China. I got hundreds of billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars. And I still got along with them.
Because they understood what they were doing was wrong. They understood it. Uh, it's -- uh, when you explain it, they sit up and they say -- I've had numerous leaders tell me, you're right, sir, I was waiting for you to bring this up. Because some of the trade deals that were made by predecessors as president was so bad, you almost wonder who did these deals?
They were either crooked or stupid. There can be nothing else. They were either stupid or crooked. It's terrible, but it's all being changed. I change a lot of it in the first four years, but it's all being changed. You know, in the first four years we had the most successful country in history in terms of economics.
We had a 88 percent increase in the stock markets. We had an 88 percent increase. There has never been any president that had an 88 percent increase. We had 88 percent. And uh, there were a lot of happy people. And I think we're going to do much better than that this time. Because this time, I'm doing what I want to do with respect to the tariffs.
I think we're going to do much better. And just remember the numbers. When you get up to $2 billion a day, $2 billion a day. They say, sir, it can't be that can it? I said, yeah, it can. It's the biggest -- the biggest transaction ever made. This is bigger than any deal you guys -- some of you work for companies.
Your companies are peanuts, I don't care how big they are, compared. This is the largest transaction in the history of our country. And don't let some of these politicians go around saying, you know, because I'm telling you these countries are calling us up kissing my ass. They are. They are dying to make a deal.
Please, please, sir, make a deal. I'll do anything. I'll do anything, sir. And then I'll see some rebel Republican, you know, some guy that wants to grandstand say, I think that Congress should take over negotiations. Let me tell you, you don't negotiate like I negotiate.
Facts.
If Congress takes over negotiating, sell America fast because you're going to go bust. You know, I just saw it today a couple of your congressmen, sir, I think we should get involved in the negotiation of the tariffs. So that's what I need. I need some -- some guy telling me how to negotiate. Aye, yi-yi. I tell you the happiest people in the world would be China.
They wouldn't be paying 104 percent, I tell you. They'd be paying no percent. We'd be paying them 104 percent. That's the beauty with these guys we got to be careful. And even the concept of it hurts your negotiation. When they see a little story like that, the other side, you know, it hurts your negotiation.
And then the fake news wants to build it up and it has no chance anyway. But uh, we have to remain united. As I defend workers from unfair trade, House Republicans have a chance this week to bring trillions and trillions of dollars pouring back into America by pushing forward with the largest tax cuts in American history, which is what you're working on right now, the largest in American history.
And you know the reason we had -- because we had a great first term and uh, an amazing first term, but I saw that the other day that we had the most successful -- I mean, I knew it anyway, but I saw that we had 88 percent increase. That's a tremendous increase. Think of that. And that's with all of the -- the difficulties and all of the fake investigations and the Adam Schiff shifts.
Can you believe this guy? He's got the smallest neck I've ever seen and the biggest head. We call them watermelon head. I'd say, how could that big fat face stand on a neck that looked like this finger? How can it? It was the weirdest thing. It's a -- it's a mystery, nobody can understand it. But he's one of the most dishonest human beings I've ever seen.
And you know, how we can allow people like that to run in office is a shame, but we did. He was in charge of the witch hunt. You know, he was in charge of the fake witch hunt with Russia, Russia, Russia. It was a made up story. Made up. Think of it, they make up a story. They know it's made up. It's gone on for a year and a half, two years.
Russia, Russia, Russia. I knew nothing about it. The only thing I knew was that I taxed the pipeline that I told you about that I put all sorts of sanctions and everything else. I never -- no -- they never had a problem like they had with me. But it was Russia, Russia, Russia constant as a method of -- that was what they did is that was the complaint about why she lost an election.
Because Crooked Hillary was expected to win the election. But they didn't. They didn't see what we saw. We saw the biggest crowds in history gathering only superseded by the crowds we just had. But here's a guy that goes out and he goes to an intelligence hearing or whatever you might call it, and it's supposed to be secret.
He'd walk out. He'd either make a call off the record. Off the record, this is Crooked Adam Schiff, Shifty Schiff. He's a shifty Adam. Or he would just go out blatantly and have a news conference. And because it had to do with me and my family, he'd go out and have a news conference. And he said, now you've got to remember, he knows it's a hoax because he made it up with Crooked Hillary, so he knows it's a hoax.
Because we're dealing with human beings on the other side. He'd say Donald Trump, Jr., the son of the President of the United States will spend many years in prison because of what he's done with Russia. Now think of that statement. On a human basis, I have a son, a young son who was being told that he's going for prison on something he has -- he doesn't even know what they're talking about.
He said, dad, I don't know what's going on. They keep talking about I'm involved with Russia. I don't know anything about Russia. I swear to you, dad. And yet, Adam Schiff goes out and makes a statement about a hoax that he made up that he knows is false. How of bad a human being do you have to be? They put my son and my family through that kind of trauma.
These are bad people. These are sick degenerates. And I used to be much nicer to them. I gave them the benefit of the doubt, but I've just seen too much. They make up a story about Russia. It was a hoax. And eventually -- now they've all admitted it was a hoax. On to the next one. That's Russia, Russia, Russia.
But they know it's a hoax. And they say about a young man that he's going to spend the rest of his life in prison because of what he's done with Russia. He knows it's a hoax. How bad do you have to be to have that happen to your son? And you know, it has a bad effect on a family, a bad effect. You know, are you OK, Don?
I am, dad, but I don't understand. They keep tying me to Russia. I don't know anything about Russia. He didn't know a damn thing about Russia. It's a disgraceful situation. That's why we got to kick their asses in the midterms. And we got to kick their asses again in four years. If we slashed taxes on American workers and producers, our economy will soar, jobs will surge, manufacturing will boom, and our country will prosper like never ever before.
We've got to get this big, beautiful deal done. We got to get it done. And get it done now. Don't wait two weeks, don't wait two weeks. Bad things happen, crazy things happen in politics. Just get the damn thing done and stop showboating. A couple of people want to, sure, we're going to get a little bit more.
A little bit more, do you know what you're going to get? You end up getting nothing. You end up getting a Democrat bill or worse. In the past 11 weeks, we've already created 350,000 jobs. It's unprecedented, including 10,000 manufacturing jobs. And we haven't even started yet. Gas prices. You know, when I came in, they said he campaigned on prices coming down.
And prices are going up. They're not going up, they're going down. Gas prices are way down. In fact, they had something $2.50 a gallon I saw on television a little while ago in between my watching my great friends on C-SPAN. I saw that the prices are down to $2.50, $2.60, $2.75. It was -- when I came in office it was $3.50, $3.75. But prices are coming down.
Prices on groceries are coming down. Prices of eggs are down like 87 percent, 87. You know, they got me with that. I told you. Before I even got an office, they would tell me about -- they're down close to 87 percent. And core inflation has dropped to the lowest levels in four years. And as I said, we had no inflation in four years despite the fact that I took in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.
And we hadn't even started yet. Nearly $6 trillion of new investment. And that number is now revised up to about $7 billion. Apple, a great company, is spending $500 billion because of tariffs. $500 billion, not $500 million, that's a lot. $500 million. You know, when I first heard the number I said you mean $500 million, you can build a lot of plants for $500 million.
No, sir, $500 billion. $500 billion? TSMC, the biggest, most powerful chip maker in the world. This is without that stupid CHIP Act where they say here's billions of dollars to a company that doesn't need it. These chip companies are loaded. They give these companies billions of dollars to build a plant in the United States.
They don't build them in the United States. They keep the money. It looks good. They give them billions. No. TSMC, I gave them no money. A great company, most powerful in the world, biggest chip company in the world. They're spending $200 billion in Arizona, building one of the biggest plants in the world.
And that's without money. All I did is say if you build -- if you don't build your plant here, you're going to pay a big tax. 25, maybe 50, maybe 75, maybe 100 percent. Nvidia is investing hundreds of billions of dollars. Johnson and Johnson is investing $55 billion. Eli Lilly is investing $27 billion. DAMAC is investing $20 billion.
We have billions and billions being invested by Merck, Clarios, Stellantis, General Motors, Honda, Nissan, Hyundai. All are putting in billions and billions and billions of dollars. They're buying sites all over. They're building because they don't want to have to pay 25 and 50 percent tariffs. They're all doing it. And I think they also have confidence in the country.
They have a president that they have confidence in. I know many of them. With the help of people in this room, we are one big, beautiful bill signing away from the greatest economy in the history of the world. And it's an overhang. You know, this bill is an overhang. Because if it doesn't get signed, we will have imposed the biggest tax on the people of this country in our country's history by 40 percent.
The biggest tax because we gave you the biggest tax cut in history. Now we're giving you another, which is one of the reasons that -- there are many reasons why we were so successful. But that's one of the big ones. The other one is that one year deduction, all-in one year deduction. That's so big. And I know they're working on that, the big deduction.
It makes people invest. But now we're working on something that's going to, I think, blow it away. This bill is unbelievable. It's going to bring a lot of money back into our country. But if we don't do it, it's going to be a disaster. And you just better hope that people believe that it was the Democrats fault.
Because you know, they're very good at saying it was our fault. It'll be the biggest tax increase in history. And all my life, as I watch politicians, I wasn't a politician, but I watched them, and I contribute to them a lot. Contributed a lot of money over the years. But I watched it. But all my life, I hear politicians saying we are going to give you a tax cut.
I will cut your taxes. We will cut your taxes. I never heard -- they're the only party that says we are going to increase your taxes vote for me. Who the hell ever heard this? Only these people. We're in a strange time. These lunatics go out and they tell everybody how you're going to have a big tax increase.
So maybe they want the bill to fail so that we can have a tax -- maybe they'll take credit for it. But I've never heard that said. I've watched politics all my life. I've never seen politicians -- politicians campaign on we're going to increase your taxes, except these crazy Democrats. As part of this legislation, I am committed to spending cuts.
And I will fight hard to include the elimination of hundreds of billions of dollars in waste, fraud and abuse in the bill. We've already found hundreds of billions of dollars through DOGE. And Elon has been terrific. He's been really terrific. But we found hundreds of billions of dollars of waste, fraud and abuse.
But now, we need to get the budget resolution. And we have to get it passed in the Senate. We have to bring it through the House. It's going to pass in both. One thing I'll say is that Thune has been great. John Thune has been great. And he's worked with your great leader hand in hand. Those two bills are coming up together.
And they're very similar. And I didn't know if that would happen. Because you have a lot of different rules, procedures, complicated stuff. But Mike has been amazing, and John Thune. And they've worked like amazingly well because they've just been going on at the same time. And we're ready to get this thing done and beyond and get rid of the debt hangover ceiling.
That's a disaster for our country and for everybody. And to give people the biggest tax cuts they've ever had. Because we're going to add them both up together. It'll be the biggest tax cuts. It'll blow away the tax cuts that we got them four years ago. If we follow through on this agenda, we will be rewarded with a phenomenal economy and a massive victory at the ballot box in 2026 because we will have a record of triumph like no president has ever had like no Congress has ever had.
They will not be able to even touch your seat. Your seat is secure. And we'll pick up 40 or 50 or even 60 seats. And we'll have something that's going to be smooth sailing for years to come. If we don't get it done because of stupidity or a couple of people that want to show how great they are, uh, you just have to laugh at them or smile at them or cry right in their face.
In less than three months, our new administration has already accomplished more than most administrations achieve in four years or eight years. And everybody says it. And we have to have this stuff documented and approved. In a matter of weeks, we've achieved the lowest level of illegal border crossings in American history.
In history. They have a plaza in front in Tijuana. Tijuana, Mexico. I wouldn't advise going there on a trip, but nevertheless. They have a plaza, a big plaza. It held hundreds of thousands of people. Yesterday morning, there were none. There was a man sweeping this massive plate of concrete, massive. And he was sweeping the concrete.
And there was nobody there. During the same period last year, Joe Biden released more than 184,000 illegal aliens into our country. Think of it. Many of these people were from jails and mental institutions, as I said. Since my inauguration, we've released a grand total of nine, nine, nine. And they were all in all cases medical emergencies.
We did that for medical emergency reasons. Last month we officially designated Tren de Aragua, MS-13 and the Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. And thanks to the Supreme Court yesterday, and today we had a big ruling, too. We had a very big ruling today. But we will continue to deport these monsters under the Alien Enemies Act.
Think of that. The Alien Enemies Act. Can you believe it? All things we wouldn't have had to do if the election weren't rigged. Now in reconciliation, we need Republicans in Congress to give us the full funding to permanently secure the border and to carry out. That's part of what we're asking for. Who could fight that?
We want to permanently secure. Without a border or without fair elections and without a good press, you don't have a country. Well, we have a lousy press. We now have a good border. And uh, we're going to get good elections pretty soon. There's a lot of clamor for it. I think it's something that you -- you should work on. You should go out and put a bill in demanding.
You demand, you know, because the states are just an agent of the federal government of you. You ought to demand paper ballots. You ought to demand one day elections. Do you know what they do when it's longer than one day? All of a sudden, well, we're fixing the room up. Move those boxes. We're putting in an air conditioner.
Oh, really? We'll move the boxes back in a few days. Or we're painting the room, please move the boxes. And you notice the boxes go out and then they get -- they move back in about half the number. Oh, it's so sick. One day election, you don't need any more than that. One day election, paper ballots. It's -- I think you should put a bill in. I mean, I don't know, who's in favor of a bill?
Who could not want it, who could not want it? But I think you should do a bill on that. And I think it would be so popular. And more importantly than popular, it's so necessary. You have to have great elections. You have to have fair and free elections. And you've got to have borders. Otherwise you don't have a country.
To quickly bring down the cost of energy and lower the price of everything on day one, I declared a national energy emergency to drill, baby, drill. We're drilling. Oh, we're drilling. I withdrew from the unbelievably expensive, for us, parrot -- the Paris Climate Accord. So we were paying -- it would have cost us $1 trillion. $1 trillion.
China doesn't come into it till like 2035. Russia is based on a 1992 standard when it was -- there was dirty. Uh, everybody was -- India was based on a very low standard. Except the United States. We had to pay immediately. We would have spent trillions of dollars on that scam. And it sounds so nice, the Paris Climate Accord, what a beautiful name.
It's it beautiful? It was a rip off of the United States. Well, don't forget, you know, I mean, I'm negotiating with these people, but if you really look, the European Union, why was that set up? It was set up to screw the United States of America. It was -- they formed -- a group of countries got together and let's make life miserable for the United States of America on trade and other things.
And they have done that. They've done that. They've treated us very badly. We don't sell cars into the European Union. We don't sell -- they won't take our agriculture. They want their own. But we take their agriculture. We take their cars by the millions. I terminated the green new scam, one of the great scams, one of the great hoaxes in the history of our country.
Only superseded by the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. I canceled Joe Biden's insane electric vehicle mandate where everybody had to have an electric vehicle in a very short period of time. Everybody was forced to have an electric vehicle. You know, they built some power stations in the Midwest. They look like gas pumps with electricity, right?
They spent $8 billion. And four of the nine of them don't work. Four of nine. They built nine or eight, but half of them don't work. They spent $8 billion bringing the cables, bringing the wires. What a great investment that was, billions of dollars they spent. And now people can go out and buy a gasoline powered car, a hybrid.
They can buy whatever they want. We don't want hydrogen because they have some big problems. They blow up and you never see who is driving the car. You'd not recognize them. That's a big problem. They were telling me about, sir, I'm really liking hydrogen cars. I said, but isn't there a problem? Yes, they tend to blow up on occasion.
I said, how bad is it? Well, we found body parts 250 yards away from the car. We think it was Mr. Jones, but we're going to go to see his dentist and see if we can -- So if you have one of those incidents, let's forget it, right? It's a bomb, it's a bomb. I don't want them to work. I actually said don't work on it. Between that and windmills, you can have windmills, too.
The most expensive form of energy ever. Anybody have a windmill by your house? Congratulations, you'll never sell your house. And today, I signed historic executive orders to unleash coal production to the highest levels ever. Because you know, coal is the most powerful thing. We have more of it than -- we have more liquid gold under our feet, oil and gas, and we have more coal than any other country, any other.
No other country has as much as we have. All different forms of coal. And take a look at China. They're building two coal plants a week. Think of that. Two a week. We are screwing around with wind. Oh, wind. These people are crazy. They say, oh, it's great for the environment. It kills all your birds. You want to see a bird cemetery?
Walk under a windmill some time. You've got birds all over the place. They're screaming for help. They got whacked. The environmentalists, it's an environmental dream. Do you know why? Because you're never going to have energy. They're the most expensive form of energy there is, 10 times more expensive than clean natural gas, 10 times -- much more expensive than coal.
And not -- They're very unreliable. Like if they wanted to watch us tonight on television, Alice, Alice, I want to watch the president tonight. I'm sorry, darling, but the windmills aren't blowing. We're going to give them confidence to do what they have to do long into the future. Because coal is going to be a big factor in our country now.
You know, it -- it does give us our electricity because there's nothing like coal in terms of power. But it's going to be clean, beautiful coal like our bill. It's going to be clean and beautiful coal miners. And by the way, they've made tremendous progress with also coal in terms of clean coal. But the coal miners standing understanding alongside of me this afternoon in the White House, they were incredible.
They were a beautiful sight to behold. These are really great American patriots, beautiful guys. I didn't want to have any arm wrestling contests with any of them. I can tell you that. They're good strong guys. That's what they want to do. They love to dig coal. That's what they want to do. They don't want to do gidgets and widgets and gadgets.
They don't want to build cell phones with their hands. They're big strong hands. They're doing a little thing. Remember when Hillary Clinton went to West Virginia? And she had decimated them three weeks before in like some state where they make little tiny circuit boards. And she said we're going to teach the miners in West Virginia how to make a circuit board with little, tiny things.
He said we're going to teach them. And then she went to West Virginia. She was going to -- she was in the campaign. And she had to go there. Do you remember that stop? It was memorable. It was one of the worst. Did they go after her? And one of the miners said, I don't want to do anything else, but dig coal.
I want to dig coal. There's so -- they said it today. That's what they love. They love doing it. It's like that in a lot of industries. People love doing what they're doing. They want to dig coal. That's what they want. They don't mind going deep in earth. They feel comfortable there. Me, I could do without it, but they feel, uh, comfortable.
They're incredible people actually, hardworking incredible people. And we're giving them their lives back. We've also begun the largest deregulation campaign in history. For every one new regulation, I have directed that 10 old regulations must be eliminated before the first one can go into effect. And we're working tirelessly to restore peace through strength and bring back the hostages held captive abroad.
We've brought a lot of them back already, but what a sad situation it is. What a sad situation that is. That would have never happened if I were president. October 7th would have never happened. And I said Russia-Ukraine would have never happened. All this stuff. Inflation would have never happened. Afghanistan disaster would have never happened.
The most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. Not leaving. I was going to leave. I'm the one that got him to a point where they could leave, but I was going to keep Bagram, the air base, the biggest -- one of the biggest in the world. I was going to keep it. Not for Afghanistan, but because it's one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons.
Wouldn't it be nice to have it? Do you know who occupies it now? China occupies it now. Can you believe how stupid this guy was? On top of that, they get blown up at the airport leaving the wrong airport. They didn't leave from Bagram. They left from a local little airport which was crowded and like crazy with the people from the towns and cities.
And the bomb went off and decimated hundreds of people, killed hundreds. We lost 13 soldiers, but we also had 42 or 48 horribly injured. Arms, legs, face horribly injured, all because we had a stupid leader. It should have never happened. We should have never been involved in that. We're also joined tonight by a number of brave souls who were recently released from -- they were recently released from Hamas captivity.
Hamas is just a disaster. The level of hatred. Where are the people? Hamas, they understand what that's all about. Where are you? That's great. How does it feel to be out? How does that feel to be out, huh? Do you want to come up here for a second? Do you want -- come on up here. Come on, come on up. Yeah, let -- let them up, please.
That's great. That's great. I'll tell you, these people, what they had to go through. I've -- I had 10 hostages in my office two weeks ago. What they had to go through is just horrible. Come on up. That's great. That is so nice to see you. That is so nice. [Inaudible] fantastic. [Inaudible]
[Three former hostages come to the podium and each spoke individually. There were not initially identified.]
Thank you. Thank you very much. President Trump, I'm here and I'm alive. President Trump, you saved my life. You saved the life of 33 hostages, that because of your efforts and your setting the hostage crisis at the high priority of what you are doing among all of the enormous issues and things that you're dealing with since you came into your position as president of the United States, you set the hostage crisis at the highest priority.
You got 33 of us home alive. We all owe our lives to you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And please -- Please continue your tremendous efforts and your tremendous actions and your tremendous accomplishments. Continue and we will get with your help all of the remaining 59 hostages still in Gaza back home.
Thank you. Thank you, President Trump for bringing my Keith home. Keith's grandchildren are the happiest. Keith's children are the happiest. Keith's family is the happiest. But I am the most happiest. Thank you so much. Thank you so much.
[The second former hostage comes to the microphone.]
We need you. We need you to bring all the hostages home. There's 24 that are alive and 59 to -- to come home to their families. Just like I received Keith, they need it, too. We have [Inaudible] standing here with us. And Eitan, his brother is underneath the ground now begging to get out. So I'm begging you all to help us. We need your help.
Thank you.
[The third former hostage comes to the microphone.]
So my name is Yahir. I've been in hell for 498 days. I've been held in hell with Hamas terrorists. When we didn't see the light, but we feel when we heard President Trump get elected, we knew, we knew that is now someone who makes the things happen. We need -- We knew that -- I'm sorry about my English, I am half Argentinian, half Israelian.
I'm sorry. We knew we needed someone who could do the things. That's President Trump. We are here because of President Trump. Thank you. Thank you for your efforts. It's really surreal to be here. You know, we -- I -- I'm a simple man. I'm -- I'm running the bar in the kibbutz in the -- in Knidos where I was lived.
And -- and now I'm here with President Trump who's running the world. We are thankful. We are really thankful, but humbly, we -- we ask -- we ask for more, the last push, the last 59 people, the last 59 hostages, among them, my brother, Eitan and what is [Inaudible] brothers Zeevi and Gali and Eviatar. All the brothers, all the families.
In a few days, we mark the Passover, right? Pesach. It's a family -- family time, so I expect that in the next [Inaudible] I -- when my mother made the [Inaudible] the matzo balls that my brother Eitan, my little brother who I call little, but he's 38, but it's my little brother. I hope it -- he can sit with us in the Seder in -- of Passover.
And wow, it's overwhelming. I -- I just want to tell you again. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you. There's a story for everybody and nobody knows. My heart is broken.
[Inaudible]
I'll mention it.
[Inaudible] OK. Be strong for us.
I -- I just want to say I said of the 59 people that you want to bring home, how are they? And how are they doing? Do you have any idea? Because they left that whole scene not long ago. And they said well, of the 59, 24 are living, the rest are dead. I just heard that. And um, I was told that before by somebody else, but 24 are living, the rest are dead.
These are young people, largely young people. Young people don't die. Young people are killed. They don't die. But the conditions were so horrible. But think of that, so of the 59. And I've had, uh, Israeli parents tell me that, uh, my son is dead, but please bring him home as though he were alive. She wanted him brought home more than -- it just seemed almost more than if her child was living.
Amazing. She just -- they wanted -- the mother and father, in three other cases, they wanted to have them brought home. I said, how is he doing? He's dead. It's only his body, but we want him home. So there's an amazing thing. But -- but the 59 that you mentioned, um, you said that 24 were alive and the rest are dead.
This is a terrible thing that's going on with Hamas. Terrible. The hatred is so incredible. It's unbelievable. And the way they were made to live was not even, uh, understandable, I think, by anybody in this audience. And you have great people in this audience that love you and they're going to fight for you.
And I just want to thank you very much. Thank you.
[Trump steps away from the microphone to speak to the three former hostages.]
[Inaudible] Thank you.
[Inaudible] You take care of yourself, OK?
Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you very much. Thank you. We'll get them back. Be careful. It's incredible what they've been forced to live with for 450, 500 days. Incredible. Nobody in this room could really understand it. And I found it hard to understand. But we'll not rest until your loved ones have been returned home. And hopefully we can do it the right way.
The -- we want to get those 24 out really fast. And we're working on it very hard. There was no chance before. This is something that should have been done right at the beginning during the past administration. On day one, we ended the so-called diversity, equity and inclusion policies across the entire federal government, the private sector.
And it's just not even allowed. I also signed an order making it the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female. We want to keep it simple. As you know, in a very important executive order, I banned men from competing in women's sports. That was done.
And I hope -- I hope all of these executive orders can be codified, can be voted on by Congress. I can't imagine any Republican that's not going to vote for him. Many, many of them, over 100. And I think every single one of them is just common sense, good -- it's good politics, but the word politics doesn't matter to me so much.
It's good for our country. If Democrats retake the House next year, they will try to reverse all of the progress that we've made, which is record setting progress. Instead of House committees run by Mike Johnson, Steve Scalise, Jim Jordan, James Comer, Ronny Jackson and so many other of our friends in this audience, the House will be run by the same band of radicals and lunatics you saw at my address to Congress, including Hakeem Jeffries, AOC, Ilhan Omar, Nancy Pelosi and weird Al Green.
He's a weird dude. He should have been treated very badly for the way he behaved that night. Think of it. They didn't stand up. They didn't pay respect to anybody, including -- think of it. Uh, you take a look at Laken Riley, you take a look at any of the people there, the parents of these incredible people, the young boy with cancer, serious cancer wanted to be in a police department, would give anything to be a policeman someday.
They refused to even applaud or acknowledge him. They're sick. There's something wrong with them. They sat as the stories were explained, two young ladies killed by, killed, savagely killed by illegal aliens. They came into our country and they killed these two young ladies. And the Democrats sat there. They didn't smile.
They didn't clap. They didn't do anything. I think you frankly win the midterms, just all you have to do is show a picture of these grieving parents, uncontrollably grieving. And they didn't get one clap out of the whole group of them. They just sat there like stoic and disgraceful. And you show that in your commercials that you're going to be putting on and you'll win every race that we have in this room.
That was a bad night for them. And now they know it. They're trying to make up for it. But they're just, I don't know, there's something wrong with them. That's why every day from now until November 2026, we're going to fight, fight, fight to elect and expand the Republican majority of the House and save our country from these radical left lunatics.
We will not be deterred. We will not stop. We will not yield. And we will never ever back down. We're not going to back down. They would lose respect if you back down. They're the ones that backed down. They're the ones that have lost their confidence. They're no good anymore. I saw politicians that were good politicians four years ago.
They're not good politicians anymore. They've lost their confidence. They've totally lost their confidence. But they can get their confidence back. So you can't rely on that too much, I guess. Together, we're liberating our country, reclaiming our wealth, unleashing our energy, protecting our children, rebuilding our military, repelling the invaders, deporting the criminals, destroying the gangs and unlocking what history will know as the Golden Age of America.
This is going to be the Golden Age of America. With your support, your commitment and your help to elect more Republicans, we will finish the job that we have really brilliantly started. It's been a brilliant period of years. And we go back to 2016. It was brilliant. Then they stole it from us by illegally rigging the election.
And we did great in that election, but we had to write it off. And we all went through hell. I went through hell, in particular. Indictments. We -- what we had to go through was hard to believe. Impeachments, two impeachments over nothing, over a phone call that was perfect. They knew it was perfect. And they found out after they realized that the calls were essentially taped by the government because you were talking to a foreign leader.
When that was played back, they didn't know what the hell to do, but they went forward with it anyway, because there are sick people. The American dream will come roaring back in our country. Together, we're going to make America greater than it's ever been before. And I just want to thank you. And congratulations on your record evening.
And I'm with you all the way. And I'm going to be campaigning with you. And we're going to win, win, win like we've never won before. And thank you to your leadership. And Mike, great job. You're doing a fantastic job. Thank you all very much.",6,wow thank you very much this is a great room and uh you know we ve done very well in this room before but right now we broke every record i just heard from mike johnson he said we broke every record sir there is over $ million that s not bad for an evening for an evening that s not bad i wonder if you ever turned the room this way you know it s interesting because i love real estate i love ballrooms they have nice ballrooms a lot of them i wonder if they ever turned it this way instead so it might be interesting this way i m not talking to a wall they think they get a better view but actually i m not sure but next time maybe we won t have to worry about that next year well we ll do $ or $ million right i mean a lot of people you broke your record attendance and you broke your money record and that s a great tribute to the republicans and the party and everything it stands for and it s wonderful and i want to thank especially speaker mike johnson because he s been incredible and we have some unbelievable supporters of our house republican majority with us as you know and with the help of everyone in this room the next year s republican party is going to defy history we re going to really defy it and we already are we re getting things done it s going to be very interesting to see this is going to be a very interesting year we have an interesting time we re making a fortune with tariffs $ billion a day do you believe it i was told $ billion a day you know i got hit by the press about tariffs we re making $ billion billion this isn t $ million that s peanuts $ billion a day and then they say gee they don t know you know this is only the enemy can be talking this way in addition we have a lot of countries coming to see us they want to make a deal and we re doing we re doing things that nobody s ever even thought about doing and we re going to defeat the radical left democrats who are out there complaining about everything all they do is complain and then they want to put men in women s sports and things like that they want men in women s sports they re still fighting for that i saw this poor guy you all know him i won t mention his name he s sort of a nice guy he s a loser he s a democrat but he s a loser and he was fighting on a big show this morning we ve got to have that it s not fair that essentially that men aren t allowed to compete against women can you believe this guy but uh let them do it i say we shouldn t be fighting a lot of these things just let them go and then just before the next election we ll unleash on them because this it would be very sad if they actually changed their policies we don t want that to happen but we re going to win the midterm elections and we re going to have a tremendous thundering landslide i really believe that and it s so important that we pass the big beautiful bill because that s going to be and i really think and i really think we re helped a lot by the tariff situation that s going on which is a good situation not a bad it s great it s going to be legendary you watch legendary in a positive way i have to say uh it s going to be legendary but i really think it actually puts pressure on those few republicans that just can t get there do you know what the alternative is a democrat bill or a chapter for the country you know we have the debt continuation and they have to do they have to do this they have to get there and i think we are there we had a great meeting today i think we are there but just in case there are a couple of republicans out there you just got to get there close your eyes and get there it s a phenomenal bill stop grandstanding just stop grandstanding boy oh boy oh boy you know their policy the democrats is horrible it s horrible think of it open borders just all of the horrible stupid things they have you don t have energy you don t have anything they ve lost their confidence everything is bad but the one thing they always vote in unison you don t see somebody that s holding up i m going to hold up and the alternative is is hell you know the alternative is hell so the republicans just have one little thing the republican party has to do is get together and damn vote if you re a single guy or a second guy you fight like hell for what you get and then in the end you have to vote because the policy is phenomenal you know they don t get every little ounce it doesn t work that way and this uh this bill that we re working on now is the best i think we ve ever passed uh mike wherever you may be it s the best i think it s the best thing we ve we ll get it passed but i think it s going to be the most important thing we ve ever passed it s the best thing we ve ever passed and i do think that the war with the world which is not a war at all because they re all coming here japan is coming here as we speak they re in a plane flying lots of them all tough negotiators but things that people wouldn t have given us two years ago wouldn t have even thought of it two years ago three years ago five years ago seven they re giving us everything they don t want tariffs on themselves and it s very simple we re making deals and people are paying tariffs countries are paying tariffs right now china is paying a percent tariff think of it percent now it sounds ridiculous but they charged us for many items percent percent many countries have they ve ripped us off left and right but now it s our turn to do the ripping that s ok we re going to make our country even stronger stronger than it ever was in republicans will fight for every state every seat and every single vote we re going to fight like hell i intend to personally campaign for candidates all across the country and we just won t you re right about that we won t just keep our majorities we want to expand our majorities by a lot you know there s this thing about midterm elections that you have a president and the president they never seem to win i don t understand they never seem to win the midterm elections and i have no idea why you know we re not going to let that be a self fulfilling prophecy i have no idea why we re setting records right now we re getting more things approved than any president has ever done in the first days it s not even close i had somebody say the most successful month first month in the history now they said the most successful days in the history of our country and i believe that s right and we re going to continue that way if not more so and we re going to do tremendously in midterms there s no reason we should do great in the midterms there s this thing that for some reason the president whoever the president is the midterms are tough why would they be tough if we re doing great they should be easy and i m telling you we re going to we got to win a lot more but as mike said before i happen to listen to him he was on c span that s a big upgrade right i was listening as i was putting on the tie how does it look he was on c span and we and they were talking about that and i thought to myself because people love him and they love your leaders they love really the party is just doing well a couple we could do without to be honest with you but but the party is doing well and there s no reason we shouldn t just get together and win these midterms and win them by a lot because seven that i heard mike talking about before and seven is not really enough but we lived for one for a period of time you know the only thing good about seven when you have one and now all of a sudden you have seven it sounds like it s like a landslide it s so good it s like uh the most amazing thing seven sounds so good when i hear that it sounds like we can t be beaten and uh we should be up honestly we should be up because based on policy these people have the worst policy that anybody has ever seen there s something wrong with them honestly there s something wrong with them all this crap house democrats currently represent districts that voted for trump and voted for trump big and in we re going to tell them all that you re fired get out out get out there s no reason for that but is a small number compared to some of these stats uh we are going to work very hard i m going to do tele rallies you know tele rallies i ll do rallies for a lot of you but i ll do tele rallies at a minimum and we just had two great elections by the way and i heard everybody is introducing our two new congress where are they please stand up i want to look you in the eye i want to look you in the eye randi i m looking at the two of them where s what a job you did man huh you were never in doubt where the hell where is our second person here i know he s oh there he is boy they gave him a lousy seat he s behind good great job we re proud of you man great job great job thank you and you know those both elections they were saying it s going to be close it s going to be close and i was listening and they won by like you won by what points points i don t think that s close i don t think it s close so we won by and points and they re saying it was a terrible evening for trump can you believe it terrible evening they only won by points and points anyway good job both of you good job but in addition to our fantastic house speaker we re pleased to be joined by majority leader steve scalise and i watched you too steve i watched you on c span and steve has suffered greatly i mean i was there the night that it looked like he wasn t going to make it he s very brave he suffered greatly and i tell the story about the baseball game where i mean he was really the doctor told me sir i ve never had anybody lose so much blood it s not looking good and his wife loved him she was such a disaster that night she was crying she was crying because i ve been with people that were in serious trouble and their wives couldn t care they couldn t care less in fact after they recovered i said do yourself a favor get rid of the wife she said no i m only kidding of course i m only kidding i like to say i m only kidding that way that cleans it up a little bit for the for the press i say i was only kidding no i ve seen some wives that were truly not bothered too much i had one where the dog died and the husband died on the same day and i said it s too bad about harry no no but lucy died lucy oh my god harry didn t mean he left her a fortune too can you believe it harry didn t matter the dog mattered a lot but i i was with steve and he was really you know that was a tough thing and then amazingly he was like a year later he was in the baseball game against the democrats and he was playing second base and he was having a hard time you know it s a hard time getting around and with his luck a shot was hit to him on the ground a ground ball and he got down and that ball was no way that ball was it was right at him but really it was whacked i don t know who the hell hit it looked like a major league ground ball and steve went down and blocked that sucker and got on his knees and threw it to first base it was the most unbelievable thing that it could happen this was god watching this was god watching a game i m telling you does everybody remember that he blocked it or knocked the hell out of his foot not his glove it was his foot and he got down and grabbed the ball threw it out and got the runner by quite a bit and uh they then took him out of the game and i said what a great move that was a good manager they took him out of the game because you can t improve on that let me tell you but he he had great courage and amazing how he s done and he s been very special and all of us know it he s really done great another man i ve really gotten to know a lot and i think he s fantastic is tom emmer the majority whip i think he s fantastic where s tom where s tom where is our tom right here because i want to see his wife you know his wife is better than him she he admits it right here oh that s good hi tom so where is she tom oh no she s not she s home she s watching c span yeah i know thank you tom great job you do and lisa you were up talking about donald trump tonight and lisa mcclain conference chair she was talking about trump and i appreciate it lisa lisa where are you lisa over here just like a roast thank you darling i saw your whole speech i watched you and steve and mike i watched the whole thing then they said sir we have to leave you re going to be late i said i want to watch these speeches and we have richard hudson the nrcc chairman who set the record tonight richard great going that s a great that s a great job and uh brian jack who was with me from day one of my political career he was so fantastic he was so fantastic and he came to me he said do you think it would be ok he wanted to run for congress he always wanted to run for congress it was the most important thing but he was with me knows so much about politics and boxing he knows a lot about boxing too but he loves politics but he really just wanted to run i think his ambition was to be a congressman and the seat came due a good member of congress actually retired and brian in georgia and brian said uh what do you think sir i said well you got my endorsement and he won by a lot and he s never looked back he s a fantastic guy and a great political leader a great politician brian jack where are you brian where are you brian hi brian great job i m proud of you brian and more than members of congress and i d like to really you ve done incredibly well they re really looking back and you know i said before the democrats have taken a lot of beatings they have lost their confidence they ve gone crazy they ve gone crazy how about this new one they have their new star crockett how about her is she is that real are they serious about that that s their new star if that s their new star they re in serious trouble i mean this is crockett oh man oh man but we have uh we ve done a job but they ve totally lost their confidence and it s a hard thing when you lose your confidence but they have they ve taken a lot of beatings and now they re going to rely on crockett to bring them back crockett is going to bring them back you ever watch this last november all the leaders here tonight were given a mandate from the american people and at the presidential level we won think of this all seven swing states we won the electoral college to that s not bad remember the fake news was saying it s going to be tough because people like trump but he should be able to get i actually went to nebraska and campaigned for one vote i went to new hampshire i campaigned because they said that it could be where a so i m going to all the places and i m trying to get one we won nebraska big but there was one area and i went there i went all over the place campaigning and then we get but we won in a landslide too because we won the popular vote for the first time of a republican in decades and now i think that s going to be done routinely we won percent of all counties in america for them and for us that s that map that you see it s all red except for the two corners they have a little blue a little line of blue for the first time in history all states shifted toward the republican party first time in history it s never happened it s a shift it s shifted republican and today there are more registered republicans than at any time in the history of our country how good how about that meanwhile approval ratings for the democrat party have plunged to the lowest level ever recorded they re at percent so you tell me about the midterms right the lowest level ever for either party the republican party is a much bigger party now than it was ever before and i must say that it s the biggest now since you heard the name donald j trump running as a politician you heard the name before but not as a politician i said to my wife you know i think i m going to do this thing do i have your approval yes darling i think you ll win see she s a supportive first lady i don t know if she believed it or not but she said it she said yes darling i think you ll win how do you think i ll do oh darling you ll win very easily even though i ve never done it before i said i have one problem i ve never done it before she said that doesn t matter you re so talented i said thank you very much this is why we get along it s easy to get along like that but we have far more people and far more enthusiasm than the parties ever had i think i could almost say than any party has ever had i don t think any party s ever had more enthusiasm than us and spirit a lot of that s our leadership the democrats are a broken party with bad policy they ve lost so much and uh look both as politicians and as people they ve lost the stage is set for a monumental victory for the republicans in the midterms and many of you i guess most of you so many great congressmen and women here got some senators here also but many of you are all of you are up we ve got to we ve got to win we ve got to work really hard and we ve got to win because there s no way they should be winning based on policy and it s ultimately about policy we simply have to keep our promises to the people and we have to very simply put america first put america first and i said i ran on common sense you know i ran on common sense it sounds like a phrase that would have been used i don t know nobody tells me it was used in politics before now everybody s used it i see the democrats some democrat guy who s a real sleazeball got up he said yeah i ran on common sense that s what i did common sense yeah and i said gee yeah but the problem in politics you come up with a little slogan and they copy it but you know they copied no tax on tips remember i said no tax on tips nevada hadn t been won for many years by a republican and the state of nevada and don t ever call it nevada you ll lose percent just call it nevada it s true it seems almost nicer the other way you know nevada sounds like brooklyn doesn t that make sense i come from nevada but don t ever call it nevada call it nevada but as you know the corrupt globalist establishment that ruled our country for decades is now complaining that i m doing exactly what i pledged to do in the campaign all of these things tariffs the men in women sports everything the borders strong borders we have the strongest border we ve ever had today it was just announced the strongest border they don t want to write that you know they forget they forget eggs i came in eggs not a very glamorous thing to talk but eggs i was in for one week and they said egg prices are soaring i said i ve just been here i didn t know this please i didn t know it the the fake news they re going egg prices are soaring and i said man i just got here you know let me know about it what s going on with eggs tell me so they gave me a little bit of a thing and it s true under biden they soared like double triple quadruple you couldn t even get them they were not available they said don t use eggs for easter use the plastic alternative plastic we got at mar a lago we ve got plastic eggs all over the place they said don t use it for easter for if you re doing an easter egg hunt do not use eggs well we have a wonderful secretary of agriculture as you know brooke rollins she s here someplace i think and she got she went after it and when she goes after something we don t play games right brooke and eggs egg prices are down now percent and you have all the eggs you want percent and they didn t write about it they don t talk about it i go up i make speeches about eggs all the time i never get a reporter or writing about it because we were successful if you re a republican when you re successful in something you have to toot your own horn talk about it because you re the only one that s going to it s a pretty rough it s a rough business i will tell you but the shrill voices that you re hearing this week about tariffs are the same scoundrels and frauds who never thought twice about when the united states lost factories and plants think of that how do you do if you had a map a big map the size of that wall and you had a pin for each factory you wouldn t have enough room if you think of it factories since nafta the worst trade deal in history by the way and we had it terminated everybody said you d never be able to it had to be terminated by congress and it was not easy it was so bad you know the people have a lot of it s very interesting they have a lot of power they have a lot of political power it s hard to get even a bad deal terminated but we did do it and we got us usmca and that s that s been really great but when they cheat it s not so good and they cheat they do cheat you know i respect mexico i respect canada but they cheat like hell you know canada charges for our dairy products percent nobody knows that they charge you two percent for the first two cartons of milk and after that you go up to and the press says they ve only charged two percent no that s for the first two cartons so it s uh you know we can t have that and we have to be wise to it and get along with everybody but we have to call people out million manufacturing jobs were lost since nafta when million illegal aliens poured across our borders think of that many of whom were violent criminals murderers drug lords and the mentally insane insane asylums were closed they used to go crazy when i talk about hannibal lecter the late great hannibal lecter right silence of the lambs the fake news would say why does he talk about that he s a fictional character he s actually not we have many of them that came across the border it s actually not but when the people went to the voting booth then we understood why he talked about that because they voted for us they said we don t want hannibal lecter in our country the great hannibal lecter he was uh he was a very important force but the press would go absolutely crazy if i mentioned hannibal lecter s name because they said he s a fictional character no but it was making a point and the point is they re emptying mental institutions and insane asylum not anymore they re not insane asylums into our country we had uh numbers the likes of which nobody s ever seen anything like it other countries i deal with other countries all the time i am right now on tariffs where they want to make a deal with us we don t necessarily want to make a deal with them we re happy the way we are taking our $ billion a day but they want to make a deal with us and they talk about it and they say we cannot believe that they had open borders these are countries they have you know they have borders and they don t let people into their country they can t understand how they did it because they re sick or they re crazy there s something really wrong with these people but the same people now telling me about how to deal with china are the ones who sold out america for decades to china for decades they gave up to china i m the only one that do you how much china has paid almost $ billion in tariffs under me and then they say donald trump hasn t been tough on china they say trump hasn t been tough on russia ok here s the story nord stream did anybody ever hear of it it s the biggest pipeline in the world i closed it russia had it and i closed it putin told me that s the worst thing you re supposed to be friendly with me i d hate to see you as my enemy and i closed nord stream when biden got in he opened it up immediately it serviced all of europe going to germany it s service to all of europe we closed it and they say oh he wasn t tough on russia i was very tough with the sanctions and everything else and by the way just for your information we re trying like hell to get the fighting stopped between russia and ukraine a thing that never would have happened if the election wasn t rigged we had a rigged election and we can say it and say it loud and say it proud because the election was rigged and we can t let that stuff happen anymore go to paper ballots go to same day voting go to voter id go to citizenship you have to prove your citizenship with little piece of paper then you won t have it it s sort of disappointing because a lot of republican governors they could do that same day voting paper ballots very sophisticated paper actually it s all watermarked you can t cheat it s very hard to cheat france went that way they were like us and they were you know having very bad elections very crooked elections they had million people they voted they had a winner they had a loser they went home that was it in the evening it was over with us did you ever see we have these machines that cost a fortune and they say we think we re going to have the final vote tally in two and a half weeks and wait a minute this is election day did you ever see where in california they were counting votes four weeks later and then they say and and by the way all paper costs eight percent of the machines why is it that republican governors aren t going to it ok what s going on with our republican governors if nothing else you say even if it was just the same and it s not it s you know it s nothing s foolproof when it comes to voting but it s pretty close but it costs eight percent in other words you can have your election eight percent the cost of the machines and you get an accurate count so it s pretty amazing they gave us nafta mass illegal immigration the democrats did the fake paris climate accord and the china s entry into the world trade organization that was a wonderful day for us china entered the world trade they ve done pretty good and you know they didn t do things exactly by the books and they were a developing nation they still are they say we are a developing nation we should be entitled to more and our people say oh that s right they re developing they re not developing we re developing look at some of our inner cities we ve got to develop them but uh we can t let the democrats get away with this stuff but we re developing more than they are the globalists have been wrong about everything and so i wear their attack on me because nobody has ever been attacked like a man named donald j trump in the history of our country nobody has ever but i wear it as a badge of honor nobody has ever been attacked i was under more investigations than the late great al capone he was the most violent criminal he was the most violent mob boss in history and i was under investigation far more than him it wasn t even close our opponents are not afraid that our america first policies will fail they re terrified that our strategy will succeed and we re going to get bigger and stronger and better as a party and that s what s happening and that is what s happening it s going to be something and i m actually looking forward to the midterms i really are we re going to prove that all of their treasonous years of betrayal will not be forgotten because it s treason what they did is treason when they allowed millions of people to pour in through open borders from all over the world they came to me that s treason what they ve done to our country is unthinkable the money we have to spend to take people out and then we have judges that say no let tren de aragua come back into our country they want they want them to come back in killers they cut off a man s fingers because he did you cut off did you sir make a phone call to the police in colorado yes i did i did you ve attack you ve attacked us and you ve taken over our building they took over real estate all over colorado uh you did right give me your hand put the hand down boom cuts off his fingers and they want him back and how about the mix up with the ms where it wasn t a tren de aragua it was an ms killer and they said oh they got it mixed up let s get them back into our country nah we got to we need people that are going to love our country i m proud to be the president for the workers not the outsourcers the president who stands up for main street not wall street who protects the middle class not the political class and who defends america not trade cheaters all over the globe they re trade cheaters they cheated on us they cheated with tariffs on us they stole our money they stole our jobs and now people are going around saying oh we re not treating them right now we re treating them very good actually they re lucky we re treating them so good and you know when i have tariffs and i say well we re going to charge what they did we re going to charge what they did and then i say i m going to charge much less than they did believe me we re actually being nice about it but we re doing very well better than we ve ever done before my job is not to maximize the profits of outsourcers and foreign i mean these foreign corporations are horrible it s horrible what they re doing but we re catching them we re catching them by the dozens my job is to defend the i have to defend the american dream and i have to defend the american citizens that s my job i have to defend that the american dream is never mentioned it was mentioned for four years and now it s being mentioned again but it was never mentioned when we had sleepy joe in office i used to have a big the hardest thing i had to do with joe biden is the nickname do i call him sleepy joe or crooked joe could we take a vote please who wants to call him crooked joe who wants to call him sleepy joe that s my problem it s like the same they both work they both work beautifully joe had one ability that i didn t have you know he said he was a good golfer he s terrible somebody said the only time i got angry during our debate when he said he was a six handicap for he s not a six he s not a ok but he had one ability that i don t have he was able to go to a beach bathing suit in tow because it looked like it was actually falling off but he d go he had a hard time walking through the sand because you know sand is heavy on your feet carrying one of those six ounce chairs that are made out of aluminum that if you weigh a little bit too much it just cracks in the middle when you sit down and he could sit down in a beach with photographers on the beach you know he s the president so he had a minimum of photographers but he still had photographers and he could fall asleep who the hell could do that who could fall asleep and he turned around and drool would be coming out he didn t care his wife didn t care it s an ability that i could never fall asleep under those circumstances i d be very conscious of my body and what we look like i d be sitting up like this and i d say darling it s time to go let s get out of here well would it most people i mean this guy could go to the beach and he was out in seconds guys are shooting him he d be in the papers the next day eyes closed mouth open the united states has been getting ripped off for years and we re simply not going to take it anymore and that s what s happening right now in the united states dominated global auto production producing more than percent of all of the cars on earth think of that percent and even higher before that today we produce percent while china produces three times more than we do let me tell you something with the tariffs that we re doing as you know we have tariffs on automobiles aluminum steel separate from the other tariffs the baseline we call it companies are pouring back into our country with plants there s a run on sites there s a run on old plants most of them are being ripped down for new plants uh they stopped building in mexico four or five plants and they come they re all coming into the united states i know what the hell i m doing i know what i m doing and you know what i m doing too that s why you vote for me and the chip makers are coming in they re all coming in we ve never had anything like this we have investment they think of about seven think of this $ trillion and that s been in a month and a half think of that for the first like you got to give me a little time to get warmed up with that so let s take the first couple of weeks off for about a month and a half we got seven almost $ trillion spoken for trillion we ve never had that i don t know if we ve ever had it at any time but if you go back and look at biden and these other campaigns any of them they had they didn t have those numbers for the year these are the biggest chip makers in the world the biggest auto manufacturers in the world $ trillion of investment and that means jobs i look at it differently not investment i look at it as jobs and they re coming in at levels that we ve never seen before and it is true that mexico they ve stopped building plants and those plants are now going to be built in the united states of america that s pretty exciting all because of two things they say they want to be nice to me they say sir because of november th the election and because of tariffs i said in that order and the smart ones say yes sir first was that you got elected and second was tariffs and i ll accept that you know but i will tell you because of tariffs but i m the only one that would have done the tariffs because everybody was afraid they were afraid of being criticized because the globalists will go after you for seven decades american ships have patrolled the seas american troops have kept the pace and peace and american wealth has enriched the globe but despite all we have given to them you will not find an american car in berlin in tokyo in seoul in shanghai not a car i used to say to angela merkel angela how many chevrolets do we have in berlin why none donald none that s right angela you got it how many chevrolets do you think we have in munich angela none donald i said you sent us million cars last year so we re going to start buying american made cars or cars that are manufactured in america and if you can do it not part of what i was going to say but one of the best things that i think i ve come up with is interest deductions if you buy a car that s made in america you get an interest deduction on the money you borrow and i love it i hope you can do it mike i hope you can do it because i haven t bugged you about that i ve been talking about no tax on tips no tax on social security no tax on overtime and i haven t really been as strong on this one but it s only because it gets a little bit long you know uh but if you think of it you buy a car you borrow money and you get a deduction on that money if the cars made in america i think that that will not cost you $ you ll make money with that one i think you ll make money actually in a certain way with the other three also i think they re very important and they were a part of our campaign i was going to say before that in nevada that when i came up with the no tax on tips i think that s why we won by a massive amount and interestingly they came up about a month and a half later and she was making one of her few speeches she didn t speak too much for a reason a good reason she was making a speech and the middle she said oh and by the way we will have and everyone s falling asleep we will have no tax on tips that place booed the hell out of it they said you re a little late on that one because i was worried they d copy me you know it was so good do you know how it actually happened maybe i should tell the story quickly i was in my building in las vegas we have a great restaurant there and this young beautiful waitress and you re not allowed to say beautiful because that s the end of your political career if you call the if you call a young woman beautiful that s the end of your career but what the hell she was beautiful so she came up to me and she said uh hello sir it s so nice to have you at the hotel i said thank you i had a group of people some political people actually it was very interesting and i said how s everything going she said oh it s so tough they re after my tips who s after them the government they re after my tips constantly after my tips they re after all of us for the tips she said sir we should have no tax on tips i said say it again what we should have no tax she said this was my consultant a waitress from my hotel most people go out and spend millions of dollars to come up with an idea i said she just said no tax on tips that s the coolest thing i ve ever heard so i went outside there were a lot of we finished our wonderful meal steak went outside and there were a lot of cameras as there always are unfortunately i say ladies and gentlemen i m going to have a new policy all over the country but specifically in nevada there will be no tax on tips right and the cameras went wild click click click click click and we won the state by a lot so i don t know so i owe i have to find that waitress and thank her she was my consultant except i didn t pay her $ million like the other consultants that we all get screwed by even worse than the tariffs other countries impose are the non monetary barriers that s a non monetary these are not financial these are other things what they do so that you can t get your product in that country and china as you know is one of the big offenders and it s not all china look i get along with president xi i have over the years but you know you just uh when covid came that was the end that was it that was called the bridge too far but i ve always had a good relationship with a very smart guy who loves his country i love our country so you know we love our country he loves his i tell that to other leaders you ve got to fight for your country it s you re not going to fight for us but we can t fight for you we re fighting for other countries we re trying to make them great without making us great but those days are over they steal our intellectual property they rob our trade secrets they manipulate their currency to levels that have never been seen before today it was announced that china is reducing it s currency did you see that big big in other words they re going to make up for it they got every trick in the book i ll tell you they are great you got to hand it to them you got to hand it to them they they re manipulating their currency today as an offset against the tariffs you re not supposed to do that the game isn t supposed to be played that way it makes it very hard for us but in the end it it s not good because they have to buy oil see we don t need oil we don t need oil and gas we have more than any other country they have to buy it that s where it hurts them when they do that it costs them twice as much and they ship their products through every one of our trading partners running up our deficits with these countries they sell a lot you know when you put a tariff on them they sell it like with steel they were dumping tremendous amounts of steel into our country curing my term i saved every steel mill every we only have steel mills because of what i did i put a high tariff on them and then percent and it stopped it stopped they were dumping so much steel we would have lost every single steel mill the people that like me best are the people in the steel business but i think the auto business is going to be right there i think chips are going to be there i think pharmaceuticals are going to be there because you know we don t make our own pharmaceuticals drugs and other things to get better they re made in other countries and you pay a number i mean the same package in our country compared to like london and other places is sometimes times more ten times more something that sells for $ in london sells for $ here made in the same factory by the same company and that s over i told them all that s over they put all of their research and development into it they put everything but what they don t tell you is that these other countries are smart they say you can t charge more than $ otherwise you can t sell your product and uh the the drug companies listen to them but we re going to do something that we have to do we re going to put we re going to tariff our pharmaceuticals and once we do that they re going to come rushing back into our country because we re the big market the advantage we have over everybody is that we re the big market so we re going to be announcing very shortly a major tariff on pharmaceuticals and when you and when they hear that they will leave china they will leave other places because they have to sell most of their product is sold here and they re going to be opening up their plants all over the place in our country we re going to be announcing that so that s breaking news ladies and gentlemen we have breaking news that s what s going to happen what other presidents allow china to get away with is absolutely criminal but i m not like the other presidents and it s not going to happen under president trump it s just not going to happen after all of the abuses they ve perpetrated china is attempting to impose additional unjustified tariffs just so you understand they all got rich because of tariffs you know now when we do it oh it s so terrible what trump is doing it s so terrible they got rich and not only china many countries i mean you look at vietnam you look at so many i could name right now biden couldn t do that he couldn t name any name one country name any country what s the name of our country he doesn t know that s why additional tariffs on chinese goods are in place effective midnight tonight at percent until they make a deal with us that s what it s going to be i think they ll make a deal at some point china will they want to make a deal they really do they want to make a deal they just don t know how to get it started because they re proud people china will now pay a big number to our treasury this is all taxes and don t let them keep telling you that this is a tax on our people i hate that you know they say it s a tax no often much of it is paid and hey look what happened during my first term we had no inflation and yet i took in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and taxes from china no other president got $ in tariffs or taxes from china i got hundreds of billions of dollars hundreds of billions of dollars and i still got along with them because they understood what they were doing was wrong they understood it uh it s uh when you explain it they sit up and they say i ve had numerous leaders tell me you re right sir i was waiting for you to bring this up because some of the trade deals that were made by predecessors as president was so bad you almost wonder who did these deals they were either crooked or stupid there can be nothing else they were either stupid or crooked it s terrible but it s all being changed i change a lot of it in the first four years but it s all being changed you know in the first four years we had the most successful country in history in terms of economics we had a percent increase in the stock markets we had an percent increase there has never been any president that had an percent increase we had percent and uh there were a lot of happy people and i think we re going to do much better than that this time because this time i m doing what i want to do with respect to the tariffs i think we re going to do much better and just remember the numbers when you get up to $ billion a day $ billion a day they say sir it can t be that can it i said yeah it can it s the biggest the biggest transaction ever made this is bigger than any deal you guys some of you work for companies your companies are peanuts i don t care how big they are compared this is the largest transaction in the history of our country and don t let some of these politicians go around saying you know because i m telling you these countries are calling us up kissing my ass they are they are dying to make a deal please please sir make a deal i ll do anything i ll do anything sir and then i ll see some rebel republican you know some guy that wants to grandstand say i think that congress should take over negotiations let me tell you you don t negotiate like i negotiate facts if congress takes over negotiating sell america fast because you re going to go bust you know i just saw it today a couple of your congressmen sir i think we should get involved in the negotiation of the tariffs so that s what i need i need some some guy telling me how to negotiate aye yi yi i tell you the happiest people in the world would be china they wouldn t be paying percent i tell you they d be paying no percent we d be paying them percent that s the beauty with these guys we got to be careful and even the concept of it hurts your negotiation when they see a little story like that the other side you know it hurts your negotiation and then the fake news wants to build it up and it has no chance anyway but uh we have to remain united as i defend workers from unfair trade house republicans have a chance this week to bring trillions and trillions of dollars pouring back into america by pushing forward with the largest tax cuts in american history which is what you re working on right now the largest in american history and you know the reason we had because we had a great first term and uh an amazing first term but i saw that the other day that we had the most successful i mean i knew it anyway but i saw that we had percent increase that s a tremendous increase think of that and that s with all of the the difficulties and all of the fake investigations and the adam schiff shifts can you believe this guy he s got the smallest neck i ve ever seen and the biggest head we call them watermelon head i d say how could that big fat face stand on a neck that looked like this finger how can it it was the weirdest thing it s a it s a mystery nobody can understand it but he s one of the most dishonest human beings i ve ever seen and you know how we can allow people like that to run in office is a shame but we did he was in charge of the witch hunt you know he was in charge of the fake witch hunt with russia russia russia it was a made up story made up think of it they make up a story they know it s made up it s gone on for a year and a half two years russia russia russia i knew nothing about it the only thing i knew was that i taxed the pipeline that i told you about that i put all sorts of sanctions and everything else i never no they never had a problem like they had with me but it was russia russia russia constant as a method of that was what they did is that was the complaint about why she lost an election because crooked hillary was expected to win the election but they didn t they didn t see what we saw we saw the biggest crowds in history gathering only superseded by the crowds we just had but here s a guy that goes out and he goes to an intelligence hearing or whatever you might call it and it s supposed to be secret he d walk out he d either make a call off the record off the record this is crooked adam schiff shifty schiff he s a shifty adam or he would just go out blatantly and have a news conference and because it had to do with me and my family he d go out and have a news conference and he said now you ve got to remember he knows it s a hoax because he made it up with crooked hillary so he knows it s a hoax because we re dealing with human beings on the other side he d say donald trump jr the son of the president of the united states will spend many years in prison because of what he s done with russia now think of that statement on a human basis i have a son a young son who was being told that he s going for prison on something he has he doesn t even know what they re talking about he said dad i don t know what s going on they keep talking about i m involved with russia i don t know anything about russia i swear to you dad and yet adam schiff goes out and makes a statement about a hoax that he made up that he knows is false how of bad a human being do you have to be they put my son and my family through that kind of trauma these are bad people these are sick degenerates and i used to be much nicer to them i gave them the benefit of the doubt but i ve just seen too much they make up a story about russia it was a hoax and eventually now they ve all admitted it was a hoax on to the next one that s russia russia russia but they know it s a hoax and they say about a young man that he s going to spend the rest of his life in prison because of what he s done with russia he knows it s a hoax how bad do you have to be to have that happen to your son and you know it has a bad effect on a family a bad effect you know are you ok don i am dad but i don t understand they keep tying me to russia i don t know anything about russia he didn t know a damn thing about russia it s a disgraceful situation that s why we got to kick their asses in the midterms and we got to kick their asses again in four years if we slashed taxes on american workers and producers our economy will soar jobs will surge manufacturing will boom and our country will prosper like never ever before we ve got to get this big beautiful deal done we got to get it done and get it done now don t wait two weeks don t wait two weeks bad things happen crazy things happen in politics just get the damn thing done and stop showboating a couple of people want to sure we re going to get a little bit more a little bit more do you know what you re going to get you end up getting nothing you end up getting a democrat bill or worse in the past weeks we ve already created jobs it s unprecedented including manufacturing jobs and we haven t even started yet gas prices you know when i came in they said he campaigned on prices coming down and prices are going up they re not going up they re going down gas prices are way down in fact they had something $ a gallon i saw on television a little while ago in between my watching my great friends on c span i saw that the prices are down to $ $ $ it was when i came in office it was $ $ but prices are coming down prices on groceries are coming down prices of eggs are down like percent you know they got me with that i told you before i even got an office they would tell me about they re down close to percent and core inflation has dropped to the lowest levels in four years and as i said we had no inflation in four years despite the fact that i took in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and we hadn t even started yet nearly $ trillion of new investment and that number is now revised up to about $ billion apple a great company is spending $ billion because of tariffs $ billion not $ million that s a lot $ million you know when i first heard the number i said you mean $ million you can build a lot of plants for $ million no sir $ billion $ billion tsmc the biggest most powerful chip maker in the world this is without that stupid chip act where they say here s billions of dollars to a company that doesn t need it these chip companies are loaded they give these companies billions of dollars to build a plant in the united states they don t build them in the united states they keep the money it looks good they give them billions no tsmc i gave them no money a great company most powerful in the world biggest chip company in the world they re spending $ billion in arizona building one of the biggest plants in the world and that s without money all i did is say if you build if you don t build your plant here you re going to pay a big tax maybe maybe maybe percent nvidia is investing hundreds of billions of dollars johnson and johnson is investing $ billion eli lilly is investing $ billion damac is investing $ billion we have billions and billions being invested by merck clarios stellantis general motors honda nissan hyundai all are putting in billions and billions and billions of dollars they re buying sites all over they re building because they don t want to have to pay and percent tariffs they re all doing it and i think they also have confidence in the country they have a president that they have confidence in i know many of them with the help of people in this room we are one big beautiful bill signing away from the greatest economy in the history of the world and it s an overhang you know this bill is an overhang because if it doesn t get signed we will have imposed the biggest tax on the people of this country in our country s history by percent the biggest tax because we gave you the biggest tax cut in history now we re giving you another which is one of the reasons that there are many reasons why we were so successful but that s one of the big ones the other one is that one year deduction all in one year deduction that s so big and i know they re working on that the big deduction it makes people invest but now we re working on something that s going to i think blow it away this bill is unbelievable it s going to bring a lot of money back into our country but if we don t do it it s going to be a disaster and you just better hope that people believe that it was the democrats fault because you know they re very good at saying it was our fault it ll be the biggest tax increase in history and all my life as i watch politicians i wasn t a politician but i watched them and i contribute to them a lot contributed a lot of money over the years but i watched it but all my life i hear politicians saying we are going to give you a tax cut i will cut your taxes we will cut your taxes i never heard they re the only party that says we are going to increase your taxes vote for me who the hell ever heard this only these people we re in a strange time these lunatics go out and they tell everybody how you re going to have a big tax increase so maybe they want the bill to fail so that we can have a tax maybe they ll take credit for it but i ve never heard that said i ve watched politics all my life i ve never seen politicians politicians campaign on we re going to increase your taxes except these crazy democrats as part of this legislation i am committed to spending cuts and i will fight hard to include the elimination of hundreds of billions of dollars in waste fraud and abuse in the bill we ve already found hundreds of billions of dollars through doge and elon has been terrific he s been really terrific but we found hundreds of billions of dollars of waste fraud and abuse but now we need to get the budget resolution and we have to get it passed in the senate we have to bring it through the house it s going to pass in both one thing i ll say is that thune has been great john thune has been great and he s worked with your great leader hand in hand those two bills are coming up together and they re very similar and i didn t know if that would happen because you have a lot of different rules procedures complicated stuff but mike has been amazing and john thune and they ve worked like amazingly well because they ve just been going on at the same time and we re ready to get this thing done and beyond and get rid of the debt hangover ceiling that s a disaster for our country and for everybody and to give people the biggest tax cuts they ve ever had because we re going to add them both up together it ll be the biggest tax cuts it ll blow away the tax cuts that we got them four years ago if we follow through on this agenda we will be rewarded with a phenomenal economy and a massive victory at the ballot box in because we will have a record of triumph like no president has ever had like no congress has ever had they will not be able to even touch your seat your seat is secure and we ll pick up or or even seats and we ll have something that s going to be smooth sailing for years to come if we don t get it done because of stupidity or a couple of people that want to show how great they are uh you just have to laugh at them or smile at them or cry right in their face in less than three months our new administration has already accomplished more than most administrations achieve in four years or eight years and everybody says it and we have to have this stuff documented and approved in a matter of weeks we ve achieved the lowest level of illegal border crossings in american history in history they have a plaza in front in tijuana tijuana mexico i wouldn t advise going there on a trip but nevertheless they have a plaza a big plaza it held hundreds of thousands of people yesterday morning there were none there was a man sweeping this massive plate of concrete massive and he was sweeping the concrete and there was nobody there during the same period last year joe biden released more than illegal aliens into our country think of it many of these people were from jails and mental institutions as i said since my inauguration we ve released a grand total of nine nine nine and they were all in all cases medical emergencies we did that for medical emergency reasons last month we officially designated tren de aragua ms and the mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations and thanks to the supreme court yesterday and today we had a big ruling too we had a very big ruling today but we will continue to deport these monsters under the alien enemies act think of that the alien enemies act can you believe it all things we wouldn t have had to do if the election weren t rigged now in reconciliation we need republicans in congress to give us the full funding to permanently secure the border and to carry out that s part of what we re asking for who could fight that we want to permanently secure without a border or without fair elections and without a good press you don t have a country well we have a lousy press we now have a good border and uh we re going to get good elections pretty soon there s a lot of clamor for it i think it s something that you you should work on you should go out and put a bill in demanding you demand you know because the states are just an agent of the federal government of you you ought to demand paper ballots you ought to demand one day elections do you know what they do when it s longer than one day all of a sudden well we re fixing the room up move those boxes we re putting in an air conditioner oh really we ll move the boxes back in a few days or we re painting the room please move the boxes and you notice the boxes go out and then they get they move back in about half the number oh it s so sick one day election you don t need any more than that one day election paper ballots it s i think you should put a bill in i mean i don t know who s in favor of a bill who could not want it who could not want it but i think you should do a bill on that and i think it would be so popular and more importantly than popular it s so necessary you have to have great elections you have to have fair and free elections and you ve got to have borders otherwise you don t have a country to quickly bring down the cost of energy and lower the price of everything on day one i declared a national energy emergency to drill baby drill we re drilling oh we re drilling i withdrew from the unbelievably expensive for us parrot the paris climate accord so we were paying it would have cost us $ trillion $ trillion china doesn t come into it till like russia is based on a standard when it was there was dirty uh everybody was india was based on a very low standard except the united states we had to pay immediately we would have spent trillions of dollars on that scam and it sounds so nice the paris climate accord what a beautiful name it s it beautiful it was a rip off of the united states well don t forget you know i mean i m negotiating with these people but if you really look the european union why was that set up it was set up to screw the united states of america it was they formed a group of countries got together and let s make life miserable for the united states of america on trade and other things and they have done that they ve done that they ve treated us very badly we don t sell cars into the european union we don t sell they won t take our agriculture they want their own but we take their agriculture we take their cars by the millions i terminated the green new scam one of the great scams one of the great hoaxes in the history of our country only superseded by the russia russia russia hoax i canceled joe biden s insane electric vehicle mandate where everybody had to have an electric vehicle in a very short period of time everybody was forced to have an electric vehicle you know they built some power stations in the midwest they look like gas pumps with electricity right they spent $ billion and four of the nine of them don t work four of nine they built nine or eight but half of them don t work they spent $ billion bringing the cables bringing the wires what a great investment that was billions of dollars they spent and now people can go out and buy a gasoline powered car a hybrid they can buy whatever they want we don t want hydrogen because they have some big problems they blow up and you never see who is driving the car you d not recognize them that s a big problem they were telling me about sir i m really liking hydrogen cars i said but isn t there a problem yes they tend to blow up on occasion i said how bad is it well we found body parts yards away from the car we think it was mr jones but we re going to go to see his dentist and see if we can so if you have one of those incidents let s forget it right it s a bomb it s a bomb i don t want them to work i actually said don t work on it between that and windmills you can have windmills too the most expensive form of energy ever anybody have a windmill by your house congratulations you ll never sell your house and today i signed historic executive orders to unleash coal production to the highest levels ever because you know coal is the most powerful thing we have more of it than we have more liquid gold under our feet oil and gas and we have more coal than any other country any other no other country has as much as we have all different forms of coal and take a look at china they re building two coal plants a week think of that two a week we are screwing around with wind oh wind these people are crazy they say oh it s great for the environment it kills all your birds you want to see a bird cemetery walk under a windmill some time you ve got birds all over the place they re screaming for help they got whacked the environmentalists it s an environmental dream do you know why because you re never going to have energy they re the most expensive form of energy there is times more expensive than clean natural gas times much more expensive than coal and not they re very unreliable like if they wanted to watch us tonight on television alice alice i want to watch the president tonight i m sorry darling but the windmills aren t blowing we re going to give them confidence to do what they have to do long into the future because coal is going to be a big factor in our country now you know it it does give us our electricity because there s nothing like coal in terms of power but it s going to be clean beautiful coal like our bill it s going to be clean and beautiful coal miners and by the way they ve made tremendous progress with also coal in terms of clean coal but the coal miners standing understanding alongside of me this afternoon in the white house they were incredible they were a beautiful sight to behold these are really great american patriots beautiful guys i didn t want to have any arm wrestling contests with any of them i can tell you that they re good strong guys that s what they want to do they love to dig coal that s what they want to do they don t want to do gidgets and widgets and gadgets they don t want to build cell phones with their hands they re big strong hands they re doing a little thing remember when hillary clinton went to west virginia and she had decimated them three weeks before in like some state where they make little tiny circuit boards and she said we re going to teach the miners in west virginia how to make a circuit board with little tiny things he said we re going to teach them and then she went to west virginia she was going to she was in the campaign and she had to go there do you remember that stop it was memorable it was one of the worst did they go after her and one of the miners said i don t want to do anything else but dig coal i want to dig coal there s so they said it today that s what they love they love doing it it s like that in a lot of industries people love doing what they re doing they want to dig coal that s what they want they don t mind going deep in earth they feel comfortable there me i could do without it but they feel uh comfortable they re incredible people actually hardworking incredible people and we re giving them their lives back we ve also begun the largest deregulation campaign in history for every one new regulation i have directed that old regulations must be eliminated before the first one can go into effect and we re working tirelessly to restore peace through strength and bring back the hostages held captive abroad we ve brought a lot of them back already but what a sad situation it is what a sad situation that is that would have never happened if i were president october th would have never happened and i said russia ukraine would have never happened all this stuff inflation would have never happened afghanistan disaster would have never happened the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country not leaving i was going to leave i m the one that got him to a point where they could leave but i was going to keep bagram the air base the biggest one of the biggest in the world i was going to keep it not for afghanistan but because it s one hour away from where china makes its nuclear weapons wouldn t it be nice to have it do you know who occupies it now china occupies it now can you believe how stupid this guy was on top of that they get blown up at the airport leaving the wrong airport they didn t leave from bagram they left from a local little airport which was crowded and like crazy with the people from the towns and cities and the bomb went off and decimated hundreds of people killed hundreds we lost soldiers but we also had or horribly injured arms legs face horribly injured all because we had a stupid leader it should have never happened we should have never been involved in that we re also joined tonight by a number of brave souls who were recently released from they were recently released from hamas captivity hamas is just a disaster the level of hatred where are the people hamas they understand what that s all about where are you that s great how does it feel to be out how does that feel to be out huh do you want to come

that before by somebody else but are living the rest are dead these are young people largely young people young people don t die young people are killed they don t die but the conditions were so horrible but think of that so of the and i ve had uh israeli parents tell me that uh my son is dead but please bring him home as though he were alive she wanted him brought home more than it just seemed almost more than if her child was living amazing she just they wanted the mother and father in three other cases they wanted to have them brought home i said how is he doing he s dead it s only his body but we want him home so there s an amazing thing but but the that you mentioned um you said that were alive and the rest are dead this is a terrible thing that s going on with hamas terrible the hatred is so incredible it s unbelievable and the way they were made to live was not even uh understandable i think by anybody in this audience and you have great people in this audience that love

incredible nobody in this room could really understand it and i found it hard to understand but we ll not rest until your loved ones have been returned home and hopefully we can do it the right way the we want to get those out really fast and we re working on it very hard there was no chance before this is something that should have been done right at the beginning during the past administration on day one we ended the so called diversity equity and inclusion policies across the entire federal government the private sector and it s just not even allowed i also signed an order making it the official policy of the united states government that there are only two genders male and female we want to keep it simple as you know in a very important executive order i banned men from competing in women s sports that was done and i hope i hope all of these executive orders can be codified can be voted on by congress i can t imagine any republican that s not going to vote for him many many of them over and i think every single one of them is just common sense good it s good politics but the word politics doesn t matter to me so much it s good for our country if democrats retake the house next year they will try to reverse all of the progress that we ve made which is record setting progress instead of house committees run by mike johnson steve scalise jim jordan james comer ronny jackson and so many other of our friends in this audience the house will be run by the same band of radicals and lunatics you saw at my address to congress including hakeem jeffries aoc ilhan omar nancy pelosi and weird al green he s a weird dude he should have been treated very badly for the way he behaved that night think of it they didn t stand up they didn t pay respect to anybody including think of it uh you take a look at laken riley you take a look at any of the people there the parents of these incredible people the young boy with cancer serious cancer wanted to be in a police department would give anything to be a policeman someday they refused to even applaud or acknowledge him they re sick there s something wrong with them they sat as the stories were explained two young ladies killed by killed savagely killed by illegal aliens they came into our country and they killed these two young ladies and the democrats sat there they didn t smile they didn t clap they didn t do anything i think you frankly win the midterms just all you have to do is show a picture of these grieving parents uncontrollably grieving and they didn t get one clap out of the whole group of them they just sat there like stoic and disgraceful and you show that in your commercials that you re going to be putting on and you ll win every race that we have in this room that was a bad night for

/Users/samantha/Desktop/speech text data/rollcall (2).csv,"You all set?
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much. Appreciate it. We just had a wonderful meeting with the greatest race car drivers in the world, and some really spectacular people that won the Indy 500 for the last, I guess, for the last four years or last two years. And Roger Penske is so incredible. And the Daytona winners and the Daytona 24-hour champions.
So it was really great to see him and to see those cars. Those cars are incredible. So there's a lot of winning out there and we're having a good day in the stock market, as you can see, an all-time record day and hopefully it continues. I think it should. Our country is stronger than it's ever been and somebody had to do that.
We had to take the medicine. We had to go through the operation and that's what we've been through. And a lot of presidents would not have done it. No president would have done it, I think, but it had to be done and I just want to thank my team. This team here and lots of others and Scott and Howard have been incredible.
And for energy, there's nobody like this man and for the roads and highways, you've done well, Sean. So we appreciate it very much, appreciate it. And if we could, let's see, we're signing a lot of executive orders and some ambassadors have been approved. And we're going to start that process right now. We're honored to have Gretchen Whitmer from Michigan, great state of Michigan, and she's really done an excellent job and a very good person.
And we're working on the Selfridge, as you know, the air base. We're trying to get the air base open, keep it open. I think, Gretchen, if you're there and Matt Hall, the speaker of the House of Michigan and he's been fantastic as the speaker. I appreciate it. We won the state, Matt.
We did.
And you helped me a lot.
I did. And you made me many speaker, so thank you, Mr. President.
That's good too. And Gretchen, I think everybody knows. So we're working on that very hard and I think we'll come home with a winner for Michigan, OK? I just spoke with the secretary of defense, sometimes we call him the secretary of war. It used to be called the secretary of war. They changed it when we became a little bit politically correct.
But I think we're in great shape. We're going to be in great shape. So thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much, Matt. Congratulations, great job. So we'll start with the first orders and I think we have one for a man named Mike Huckabee. Does anyone know Mike Huckabee?
Yes, sir.
He's going to be a great ambassador to Israel and they're thrilled to have him, that I can tell you. Go ahead.
Yes, sir. So the Senate confirmed Governor Huckabee to be your next ambassador to Israel earlier today. That's his commission as ambassador. And then we also have a transmittal letter to the president of Israel, requesting that he accept Governor Huckabee's, or excuse me, Ambassador Huckabee's credentials.
He's going to be fantastic. He's going to bring home the bacon, even though bacon isn't too big in Israel.
This is the third letter --
I had to clear that up.
Well said.
OK.
Thank you, sir.
Congratulations to Mike.
To Mike Huckabee. Yeah. Next, sir, this is a big one. As you've consistently identified, restoring our maritime dominance as a nation is very important, from shipbuilding to having a merchant marine that's capable of supporting American military efforts really up and down the line, restoring maritime dominance has been a priority of this administration.
This executive order, which was prepared primarily by your National Security Council staff and National Security Advisor Walt, has a number of very significant policy steps, all aimed at restoring American maritime dominance and ensuring that we have the shipbuilding capacity and ability to compete globally, both militarily and in the civilian space as well.
And that could be a good one for Michigan too because we're going to be spending a lot of money on shipbuilding. We're way, way, way behind. We used to build a ship a day and now we don't do a ship a year, practically, and we have the capacity to do it. So we'll talk to you about that, OK, Matt? Think about that.
Matt's a natural. OK. Shipbuilding, that's a good one. OK. Thank you.
Thank you, sir. The next executive order relates to defense procurement. Our current defense procurement process has been criticized by many folks on both sides of the aisle as being too slow, too slow to adapt to new and changing technologies, not delivering the sorts of weapons and systems that our warfighters need in order to compete on the battlefields of the future.
So with this executive order, we're going to be modernizing the procurement structure the department of defense uses to allow it to more quickly adapt to changing circumstances around the world. And we're also going to be launching a review of existing procurement programs to ensure that we're getting value for the money and to ensure that we're getting the best possible systems in the field.
And which are currently horrible, I'll tell you. They're horrible. That process is ridiculous, what they do. They get the highest price and not even good-looking equipment and we're changing it. We're going to change it to the best, so this is very important. And I want to say hello to Brooke.
Hi, sir.
Well, look at Brooke. She got the cost of eggs down 87 percent, 87 percent, Governor. We have somebody that's done a great job at Department of Agriculture. And Kristi Noem, who perhaps a few of you have heard of. She has done the most unbelievable job as somebody that's watching over our country at the border, and with Tom Homan and your whole staff of tremendous people.
So thank you.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Who would think that she's -- she is meant for that job, huh? She's meant for it. I just saw you there, both. Thank you very much.
Thank you.
OK. We'll do it later, please.
Thank you, sir. Lastly, in the defense space, one persistent issue that we've had, in terms of the issue of foreign defense sales that we're unable to provide weapon systems in a reliable, effective way to key allies of ours. And a key driver of that is inefficiencies and inconsistencies with the process by which we approve foreign military sales.
So this executive order is going to direct your Department of Defense, Department of State and other relevant departments and agencies to rework our system of foreign defense sales to ensure that we can provide equipment, creating American jobs and providing obviously revenue to American defense manufacturers, but provide key military equipment to our key allies in a reliable, effective way.
OK. That's good, all very important. OK. Because our budget is just about approved and it's a big budget and we want to spend the money properly, get the best equipment in the world. We rebuilt our military during my first term, rebuilt it entirely, beautiful, and then some was given away to Afghanistan so stupidly, the most embarrassing day in the history of our country, I think.
But we have to fix it up a little bit and that's what we're going to do. We're going to do a good job of it too. Thank you.
Next up, sir, we have a series of executive orders and a memorandum all relating to deregulation, which has obviously been a major priority of your administration. The first of these is an executive order. The Biden administration launched what you've called a war on showers. They had certain regulations that basically killed the water pressure of showers and other water appliances.
You can say it, go ahead. What are the appliances?
I mean, it's everything, sir.
[Inaudible]
Dishwashers toilets sinks, um, but the showerheads are a huge deal.
There's no water. You don't get water. It's ridiculous.
So with this executive order we're effectively going to be reversing that set of regulations to ensure that Americans have choice in the consumer market. If they want a low flow showerhead, they can buy one. If they want a real deal showerhead, they should have the ability to get one.
They don't. Nobody wants it. You buy a new house. You pay a lot of money and the developers, you're not allowed to do anything more. They put restrictions on. They used to have a restrictor where you could take it out, but now they weld it in and you take a shower or wash your hands, whatever you do, including dishwashers where no water comes out, but you wash your hands, and in my case, I like to take a nice shower to take care of my beautiful hair.
I have to stand under the shower for 15 minutes until it gets wet, it comes out, drip, drip, drip, it's ridiculous. And what you do is you end up washing your hands five times longer. So it's the same water and we're going to open it up so that people can live. And we're going to hopefully have Congress approve it, so it's memorialized.
We're going to try and get all of these things, including straws, a little things like straws. We did straws a month ago, where the paper straws were melting, they were dissolving. They weren't working well and we went back to the plastic straws. We're going to get Congress to memorialize just about everything we've done here because most of it is common sense.
But the water is horrible. When you go into a new -- anytime you see a new faucet, you know it's going to be a long wash of the hands and so we're changing it. It's a big deal. I did it in the first administration. Biden came in and his first week, and he had no idea what he was doing but somebody told him to do it. And his first week he put the restrictions on all the bathroom utilities.
Even in areas that have so much water, they don't know what to do with it. You see those areas all the time with the flooding. So we're doing that and we're going to get all of the things that you've seen. I think we set a record. We're up to almost 205 hundred amendments. Nobody's ever done that. We're going to get them approved by Congress, so they're memorialized and we look forward to doing that, very important.
And Congress is going to start working on it as soon as we get the big beautiful deal done. The big beautiful deal is important. The biggest tax cuts in the history of our country, that's important. OK. OK. Is that OK? Good. [Inaudible]
[Inaudible] a good shower. It's amazing.
We rate the signatures. That was a 10 [Inaudible]
This is another executive order relating to deregulation, sir. There are a lot of regulations on the books that either promote monopoly directly or prevent new market entrants from entering into a given market. The net effect of that is very negative for consumers. So what this executive order is going to do is direct your departments and agencies to work with the FTC, with the attorney general, with the department of justice to ensure that the regulations we have on the books don't function as anti-competitive barriers to new market entrants.
The net effect of all of that is going to hopefully be market forces that that redound to the benefit of consumers and ordinary Americans as opposed to monopolistic businesses.
I said yesterday, he was a great, great student at Harvard before it went bad. It's gone really bad now. I heard they're teaching their students, mathematics, basic mathematics, can you believe it? So what does that mean? They're allowing people in, they can't add two and two? What's going on at Harvard?
I went to law school there, sir, and it was pretty liberal when I was there, but it's gone way off the deep end in recent years.
I don't know if you read that. They're teaching them basic mathematics, people that got accepted to Harvard. How come they got accepted, they don't have mathematics? And we're holding back $8 billion. Can we believe? We give Harvard $8 billion and we're holding back Columbia, we're holding back a lot of the schools because they were woke and they've hurt a lot of people.
OK. Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
OK.
There are a large number of regulations on the books. These are regulations that are currently in effect that we believe blatantly violate the law, blatantly violates Supreme Court precedent that otherwise are just blatantly illegal. So what this presidential memorandum does, basically just directs the heads of your departments and agencies to follow the law and to cease enforcing regulations that are blatantly illegal or unconstitutional.
That's a big deal. It's really very important that we get these memorialized.
Yes, sir.
Congress, very important for the long haul, right?
Yes, sir. This is the last of our deregulatory EOs for the day. This is zero based regulatory budgeting. The idea here is that over time, regulations accumulate on the books and in the Federal Register and people aren't taking a close detailed look at what's on the books and clearing them out as times change or as regulations become dated or ineffective.
What this executive order is going to require is each of your departments and agencies to scrutinize on a continuing rolling basis, all of the regulations they actually have on the books and sunset those that either no longer serve a purpose or the departments and agencies can't identify a specific reason for keeping them active.
OK. OK.
Thank you, sir. Sir, you've taken action against a number of law firms that have in one way or another been involved in the weaponization of government or actions of lawfare. One of those law firms is Susman Godfrey. Similar to what we've done previously with other law firms, this is an executive order that takes certain measures against Susman Godfrey to ensure that they can't access government resources, government buildings, scrutinizing certain aspects of their practices as a law firm, given their previous activities.
And we've signed with many law firms, the ones that we thought were inappropriate and they've all agreed to pay, let's say $1 million. They went for some pretty big numbers. I guess we have a total -- what do we have? What's the total about? What's the total right now, Steve, about would you say?
Getting close to probably $600 million, $700 million now, I would think, multiple at $100 million, some at $125 million. So the numbers are adding up. We're going to be close to a billion soon.
One at $40 million, $40 million. Millions of dollars an hour, but they don't admit guilt. Remember that, they don't admit guilt. And we have another five to go, I think five of them. And this one is just, we're just starting a process with this one.
Yes, sir.
All right, because there were some very bad things that happened with these law firms.
And this firm was very involved in the election misconduct.
Weren't they all involved in the election misconduct? I think they were all involved.
Yes.
Anyway, so they went from $40 million to $125 million. And most of them were at about $100 million, right? All right. Thank you.
Thank you, sir. The next presidential memorandum we have for you relates to Miles Taylor. You may recall that Miles Taylor served in the Department of Homeland Security during your previous administration. In his capacity with the Department of Homeland Security, he leaked classified information. He wrote a book under the pseudonym, Anonymous, making outrageous claims both about your administration and about others in it. What this presidential memorandum is going to do, one, it's going to strip any act of clearance that he has in light of his past activities involving classified information.
It's also going to order the Department of Justice to investigate his activities to see what else might come up in that context, given his egregious behavior during your previous administration.
And I had no idea who this guy was. I had no idea. I saw him on CNN, or one of them, I guess CNN, a lot. He'd be on all the time saying that the president this, the president -- I had no idea. It's like, in this office, you have a lot of young people and they're here. I'll see them for two minutes and I assume he was in the office, but I barely remember him.
I barely remember him. It was somebody that went out and wrote a book and said all sorts of terrible things that were all lies. And it was like he was this gentleman or that gentleman, like I dealt with him all the time. I had no idea who this guy -- I said who the hell is, Miles Taylor? And he made a living on going on CNN, talking about the president.
And I think what he did, he wrote a book, Anonymous, said all sorts of lies, bad things. And I think it's a traitor. It's like spying. He walks into the office, he's supposed to be sitting here -- a lot of people, I'll be here and they'll be 20 people standing in the room. They'll be oftentimes young people in the office.
I assume he was one of them, at least, but I didn't know anything about him and he wrote a book, Anonymous, and I always thought it was terrible. And now we have a chance to find out whether or not it was terrible, but it was a work of fiction. And a lot of publicity, he got himself a nice job with CNN, or one of them.
And I think we have to do something about it. You can't have that happen. If that happens to other presidents, it wouldn't be sustainable for other presidents. I seem to be able to sustain, but if that happened to other presidents, I mean, it's just unfair. And if it was a democrat president, I'd say that's a terrible thing.
A thing like that can happen, that's a terrible thing. And it's time to find out whether or not somebody can do that. Can they write a book about very confidential meetings, because they happen to be one of a lot of people in a room and they go out and write a book, and worse than that, call it Anonymous, like it's a big deal?
And everybody saying, who is it, who is it, who is it? Then it was found out who he was a long time later and he got a lot of publicity off that one. He's like a promoter. But we're going to find out whether or not somebody is allowed to do that. I think it's a very important case and I think he's guilty of treason, if you want to know the truth, but we'll find out.
And I assume we're recommending this to the Department of Justice?
Yes, sir.
OK. Good. Terrible guy.
Similarly, sir, Christopher Krebs, the former head of CISA, this is a man who weaponized his position against free speech in the election context and the context of COVID-19. This is another, it's a similar presidential memorandum to the one you just signed. It addresses his access to government existing clearances he might have and further instructs your Department of Justice, other aspects of your government to investigate some of the malign acts that he participated in, while he was still head of CISA.
This is another one. I don't know that I met him. I'm sure I met him, but I didn't know him and he came out right after the election, which was a rigged election, a badly rigged election. We did phenomenally in that election. Look, what happened to our country because of it, open borders millions of people coming into our country.
Russia and Ukraine, that would have never happened. October 7th would have never happened. Afghanistan, the way that they withdrew with 13 dead, but so many killed, actually. I mean, so many killed outside of the 13 soldiers, hundreds of people killed and maybe, I don't know, never mentioned, but I mentioned it 42 or 43 people so badly injured, the legs, the arms blown off, the face.
And this is all because of an incompetent group of people that preceded us, and that would have never happened. And this guy, Krebs, was saying, oh, the election was great, it was great. Well, it's been proven that it was not only not great. When you look at all these lawyers and law firms that are signing, giving us hundreds of millions of dollars, it was proven by so many different ways, in so many different forms, from the legislature's not approving to the 51 intelligence agents that worked from all of the different scamming operations.
It was a very corrupt election. They used COVID to cheat. And we're going to find out about this guy too, because this guy's a wise guy. He said, we would prove this is the most secure election in the history of our country. No, this was a disaster. And frankly, we should go to paper ballots, same-day voting, voter ID and one other thing, you should get a little certificate that says you're a citizen of our country.
You get a citizen piece of paper that says you're a citizen before you can vote. But you want voter ID and you want paper ballots and you really want same-day voting. If you don't have same-day voting, they decide to change the air conditioner, oh, we're fixing the air, let's move all these boxes. We'll bring them back in a few days and then they don't bring back those boxes.
We got to have safe elections. We have to have borders. Ideally, we have to have a free press, which we don't have. We don't have a free press. We have a very dishonest press. It's an honor. We're going to find out whether or not he was right. This was a disgraceful election and this guy sat back, saying, well, I'm a member, like he's a republican or something.
And almost right from the beginning and he's tried to make the case that this election was a safe election. I think he said, this is the safest election we've ever had. And yet, every day you read in the papers about more and more fraud that's discovered. He's the fraud. He's a disgrace. So we'll find out whether or not it was a safe election.
And if it wasn't, he's got a big price to pay and he's a bad guy. He's another one. I have no idea who he is. Krebs, had no idea who he is. I'm sure he was in the room at some point, just like you're all in the room, but I have no idea who he was. So thank you very much. Those last two are very important, I think, for the country.
Thank you, sir. And lastly, we just have three proclamations. These are the sorts of things that most presidents use an autopen for. You obviously don't like using the autopen much, if at all. The first of these is National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day. This is one that you did in each of, I believe, each of the years of your previous administration.
It recognizes former prisoners of war. More generally, this proclamation is written uh to acknowledge the great steps you've made both in this administration and your previous administration on behalf of veterans, homeless veterans, others who have suffered in that way. And basically, stating that it's a priority of your administration to ensure that veterans and homeless veterans are cared for properly.
Good. And you know what, they ought to find out who was using that autopen. Because whoever that person was, he or she was like the president of the United States and I'm against autopens. I think autopens are not a good thing, especially when you're talking about documents like we're signing today. If he can't sign, then he can't be president.
It's pretty simple. Let's see whether or not he could sign, but I think that should be tested. I really think that should be tested. It's another one, and you may think about it, because how can a man that -- did he really know that when they gave all false information on the council, I mean, the whole unselect Committee of political lunatics, they destroyed all the information.
You can't get any information. They went for like a year and a half, almost two years, screaming and ranting and raving, democrats plus two worse than democrats. You had Cheney, Liz Cheney and crying Adam Kinzinger, crying Adam. Every time I looked at him, he was crying. The guy was a crier, but you can't do that.
You just can't do that. So we're going to find out a lot. I think we're going to find out a lot. These last three or four have been very -- they've been very, very interesting. We'll see what happens.
Yes, sir.
But I don't think a president should be allowed to use an autopen when they're signing very important legislation. I think a President should sign it, not use an autopen. And we're going to find out whether or not he knew what the hell he was doing. I'm sure at this point, he'll say, I signed it. They'll tell him what to say.
But to give pardons to people that destroyed all the information if you destroyed information on a civil case. Just a civil case, not a criminal case, a civil case, they put you in jail for that. And they found out that Pelosi was the one that was in charge of the security of the Capitol. She knew all about it and she admitted her guilt to her daughter, who was a movie documentary person.
I'm sure her daughter is not too happy about that. I'm sure crazy Nancy's not too happy, but we found out all the things, everything. And we go for the information, sir, we've destroyed all of that information. If I ever destroyed it, I wouldn't be sitting here right now. I guarantee you that. I'd be sitting someplace else.
So I think it's something that we should really look at because that's so important. The whole concept of an autopen, because autopens are run by somebody. Whoever ran the autopen was president of the United States and I would be willing to bet that Biden didn't know, probably didn't know anything about any of it. Very dangerous, very dangerous.
So you're going to check that out, right?
Yes, sir. We're working on it right now, sir.
This is just another proclamation, sir, declaring national crime victims' rights week. You've obviously made it a major priority of your administration to track down and at times, deport criminals who have committed violence on our streets who have victimized so many people. This is an annual proclamation that hopefully gets Americans to remember that when crimes occur, there are real victims.
There are real people who are affected and there are people who suffer as a result.
OK. It's very important. Thank you. I just want to add, so we're working very hard with the democrats, the governor, with Matt Hall, with a lot of transportation, Sean and all of the people trying to keep Selfridge Air Force Base open, strong, thriving, and I think we're going to be successful. Governor, I think we'll be very successful that.
We've gotten some good feedback from Pete Hegseth and Department of Defense, and they're talking about F-16s. They're talking about F-35s, etc. It's a great piece of property. It's a great location and it's a great state. So I think we're going to come back with a very good answer. We're also working on a certain fish that's taken over a beautiful lake called Michigan, right?
And that's a tough one. That's a tough one. Do you want to just talk about that?
Sure, Mr. President. Yeah, first of all, I want to thank you for caring so much about Michigan. We've been working a long time. We couldn't get Joe Biden to do anything about either one of these issues, particularly Selfridge Air Force Base. It'll be critical to Michigan's economy and our security, when you're able to deliver us another mission there.
But on the Asian carp, for years when Obama was there, we could never get anyone to do anything about this invasive species that's going to destroy our Great Lakes. You know how important recreational fishing and so much of that is to our state. Because of your work, we're hopeful that we'll get a solution there and we'll get that barrier built so we can protect our Great Lakes.
So thank you, Mr. President.
And they're very powerful fish. I mean, I see them. They jump out of the water. They jump at the fishermen. I mean, I've never seen anything like it. And has this gotten into any of the other lakes yet? Because you would think it would be pretty easy because they're all sort of connected. Governor?
It's why we're working so hard to make sure that you know, we work with the Army Corps and erect a barrier so that the Asian carp can't get into Lake Michigan. It'll devastate the ecosystem, the economy, tourism. And it's 20 percent of the world's fresh water is in the Great Lakes, Mr. President, which is why it's so important that as a nation, we protect the pristine waters.
We better stop that now.
Yeah.
And you know, all of a sudden, I assume the lakes are all interconnected, right? So at some point they're going to be in the other lakes and so we're going to work hard on that. I spoke with the Army Corps of Engineers and they have a method. It's a pretty gruesome method, but it's a method, and I think they know what to do. So we're going to work on that very hard.
And thank you, Governor, very much. It's sort of a bipartisan thing when you get right down to it. It's a very expensive thing, actually, costs a lot. I looked at the numbers. I said, wow, but we have to save Lake Michigan because these fish, they eat everything in their way, including the other fish. They eat everything.
Are people endangered by the fish?
I mean, they're going to eat all the fish there. We won't be able to fish anymore. And that's a big deal in Lake Michigan. There's a lot of fishing, recreation. So it's going to be a problem there. But you're right, it's bipartisan, sir. But you're the one taking action on these issues.
We couldn't get Biden to do it on Selfridge. This thing has been delayed for, what, 15 years, where we were trying to do it. It started under Obama where we were trying to do it. He wouldn't do anything about it. So we appreciate you paying so much attention to this and taking action, sir.
Well, I would -- and the governor, in all fairness, called me about it. And I had seen it and she called me and John James called me and we spoke with your office. And I want to put that down, really is bipartisan. It's great to see it, actually. It's great to see that, and that includes Selfridge too. And we're going to get it done and we'll all stand there together and cut a ribbon.
OK? Gretchen? Good. That's good. Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I'm glad you brought it up and I'm glad you brought it up, Matt, appreciate it. And I know you two get along pretty well, right?
Yeah, about 70 percent of the time.
All right, good. We'll have something to celebrate pretty soon. So I'm pretty sure about that. OK?
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you, Gretchen. Thank you very much. OK. Do you have any questions?
Mr. President, where does the TikTok deal stand, given what we've seen, we know the tariffs in China?
Well, it's moving along, but obviously, I would say right now, China is not exactly thrilled about signing it. We have a deal with some very good people, some very rich companies that would do a great job with it. But we're going to have to wait to see what's going to happen with China.
[Inaudible]
No, it's on the table very much. I think China's going to want to do it, actually.
Mr. President, can you explain more of what you believe is the end game with China? Are you waiting for President Xi to blink? How do you think this is all going to be resolved?
No. Look, for years, we've been ripped off and taken advantage of by China and others in all fairness, but by China, that's the big one. And it's just one of those things. You know, we're making $2 billion a day right now in this country, $2 billion a day with tariffs, and they were making $2 billion a day.
We'll be making more now when you see what happened today. I don't know if it's still there. I looked an hour ago, but we were up like close to 3,000 points. Nobody's ever seen a day like that. I think that's a record, isn't it, fellas?
Definitely.
Is that a record? Who would have thought we were going to have a record like that after watching? But because the geniuses of the world, they get it. Our country is very strong. We were left a very, very weakened country, both economically, financially because of all of the tariffs and all of the other companies just raiding us and ripping us off.
And also at the border, where 21 million people are allowed to come in. Many of those people were criminals, but the people that do this for a living, some of them are very smart, and some of them aren't smart at all. But these guys are very smart and my group is very smart. My whole group is smart. And you've done so amazing on the boarder.
I read the other day that there were nine people and hundreds of thousands, two years ago with Biden, and we had nine. We had it down to nine and they were all let in for medical reasons. They were in bad shape. We let them in for medical reasons, not even for anything else. So you've been amazing, but that's a big thing.
I think it's one of the greatest problems. I've never seen anything like it, open borders. The whole world was emptied out, prisons from all over the world, from the Congo, in Africa, from Africa to Asia, a lot in South America. But it wasn't just South America. Prisons emptied out, and I said it outside with the drivers before, but El Salvador has been amazing.
The job that the president has done. He's coming to see me next week, and we look forward to that. But that's really been amazing. Yes?
Mr. President, the EU also announced increases in tariffs today. Why not treat --
That's bad timing for them. That's bad timing.
Why not --
They said they didn't put them in. No, they threatened them but they picked a later, which our expectation is, it's going to be later still.
OK. Good. I'm glad that they held back.
You said you were watching the markets. If this was the strategy all along to bring them to the table, why did you instruct, or advise, or maybe they did it on their own, some of your top aides, to say this is not a negotiation, to hold the line, that they were going to hold the line, that you were not going to change your mind?
Well, a lot of times it's not a negotiation until it is and that happens. And I said outside that you have to have flexibility to do it right, and that's what we have. We brought everybody to the table and it may not be a negotiation. It may not last. I mean, you know things may be as that I think are not fair to us. Look, we've been ripped off by, essentially, everybody for 35 years.
This is not just a new thing. And Roger Penske just left. He's a great gentleman, a great man, actually. And he said no other president would have had the guts to do this. And I believe that's right. They wouldn't have done it. They should have done this a long time ago, a long time ago, they should have done -- I started it with China.
I took in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and taxes from China in my first term and we had the greatest economy. We were up 88 percent on the stock market. That was the greatest ever in the history of our country, but it had to be done, something that had to be done.
Mr. President, thank you so much. Which countries will be negotiating first? Do you have any criteria, because, for example, Brazil and the UK, they do not have deficits with the US. They have a surplus, they do not have a surplus, they have deficits with the US. So what is the criteria? And also, would you consider talking or meeting with Xi Jinping?
Oh, sure, I would. He's a friend of mine. I like him. President Xi, I like him. I respect him, but they haven't treated our country right. Sure, I'd meet with him. On the other countries, Japan is here and South Korea is here, and others are here and we're trying to see them. From what I hear, it's much more than 75. I said 75 plus.
So many.
Everybody wants to make a deal, actually. And we want to do what's right for our country. We also want to do what's right for the world. The world is important. I mean, it's the world, right? And I think we're going to make a lot of people very happy. And I think investing in the United States of America will be the greatest investment that anybody's ever made.
Mr. President, [Inaudible] see the sectoral tariffs, so the pharmaceuticals, steel, is that something you're still considering moving forward will?
Yeah, well I will be because we want them coming back. We realized during COVID, that we don't make our drugs and our pharmaceuticals in this country. So I realized that and it was a big realization. We had to go to China to get drugs. We had to go to other places. I won't even mention the names, but we had to go to other places.
We don't make it and that's because we let them leave. And now, if they want to come back, we're going to put tariffs on the pharmaceutical companies and they're going to all want to come back. They're going to come back. I'm not going to pay them any money, like Biden with the chip deal. That chip deal was horrible.
They give billions and billions of dollars to chip companies. All they have is money. They have so much money and they give billions of dollars and they're just going to keep the money. They're not going to spend it. The only thing that's going to bring them back is you say, we have a barrier, you have to pay 50 percent or 100 percent or 200 percent.
And if they have to pay that, they're going to say, we're not going to pay that, we're going to build here and that's what happened. We have the biggest, most prestigious chip company in the world spending $200 billion to $300 billion, billion. Think of that, billion dollars to build essentially one massive plant.
It will be one of the largest plants in the world and we're going to get them very quickly. We're going to get them energy. We're going to get them the electricity they need and the energy that they need and it will be approved by Lee Zeldin, a total professional, and it will be approved very quickly. And they'll get their zoning very quickly.
They'll have everything done in a matter of months.
Thank you, sir. You've procured a record amount of private sector investments since your election, $7 trillion. You talked about the importance of all that. Can you talk about how these investments will have a positive impact on families who felt like the previous economy left them behind? And why your executive orders on coal yesterday is so important given the amount of manufacturing that you're ushering back in?
Well, thank you, which is correct. We have, I would say more than $7 trillion now of investment coming in. Apple is coming in for $500 billion alone. We have other companies coming in with massive numbers. We have car companies that are coming in. We've never seen anything like it, maybe in the 1940s or 50s or something, but we've never seen anything like it. They had three plants canceled in Mexico, not that we want to hurt Mexico, but we're for us and that's what my job is. It's not to take care of other countries, but I want to help other countries as much as I can.
But we have to take care of America first and it's about America first. So we have many, many companies coming in that would have never come in if we didn't win the election and then put the tariffs on. And they're coming in because when they build in the United States, there are no tariffs. You don't have to pay any tariffs.
So instead of paying 30, 40, 50 percent or 25 percent, but it could go a lot higher in some of the industries. So we have steel mills right now that are raging. The steel industry has gone -- if I didn't put the tariffs on steel, because China was dumping massive amounts of steel in my first term and I put tariffs on it. I saved the steel industry.
But now it's going to thrive, maybe like never before. I mean, if you go back to US steel from 90 years ago, it's incredible. It's the number one company in the world for a long time. That's why we don't want to see it go to Japan. And we love Japan, but US steel is a very special company. We don't want it to go to Japan or any other place.
So we're working with them and I don't know if they need any money now. I'll be honest with you, they hit gold. They hit gold because if you look at it, they have such orders for steel now it's incredible. What's going on in our country is incredible, with respect to plants. So we lost 90,000 plants and factories from the beginning of NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made in the history of this world.
But certainly, in the history of trade. There's never been a worse trade deal. We were able to cancel that. We had to get approval from Congress. It was like it was a disastrous curse because you you had to go to Congress to get it terminated. You couldn't just terminate it because it was a bad deal and you had people in Congress that didn't want to do it because they had other reasons, maybe bad reasons.
They're mostly not there anymore, those people. But it's amazing what's happened. I appreciate that question because it's an incredible. I don't think we've ever seen anything like it, $7 trillion. And it's much more than that, because these are places that we know. $7 trillion is unheard of. I never looked at the Biden numbers, but you could go a whole year and it was peanuts.
Everybody was leaving. They weren't coming in. They were leaving and that means jobs are leaving. And so we're not playing games. We're going to make this country greater than ever before. Thank you for that question.
Mr. President, it seems that China --
Let her just do that and we'll get you.
Oh, yeah, absolutely. Thanks. For the past few days, we've heard from this administration no pause. Was this idea of doing a pause, did that just come about this morning? Can you tell us exactly what came into consideration for you and your advisors?
For a period of time. I wouldn't say this morning. Over the last few days I've been thinking about it. I've been dealing with Scott with Howard with some other people that are very professional. And I think it probably came together early this morning, fairly early this morning, just wrote it up. We didn't have the use of -- we didn't have access to lawyers or we just wrote up -- we wrote it up from our hearts, right?
It was written from the heart and I think it was well written too, but it was written from the heart. It was written as something that I think was very positive for the world and for us. And we don't want to hurt countries that don't need to be hurt, and they all want to negotiate. The only problem is you can only do so many at one time.
We want to do it right. We want to get it right. We want to take care of them, but we have to take care of our country. But this was something, certainly, we've been talking about for a period of time and we decided to pull the trigger. And we did it today and we're happy about it. I didn't know it would have that kind of an impact, but I think, have the biggest increase in the history of the stock market.
That's pretty good. You're almost, if you keep going, you're going to be back to where it was four weeks ago. But it was a sick market four weeks ago, because this trade was sick. It was only a question of time. I don't blame the tariffs. I think the tariffs just sort of magnified what was happening. It was sick.
Biden allowed these people to get away with murder. Biden allowed China to just take advantage of us. We had, like, $1 trillion deficit with China, trillion dollar deficit. So that was going to only be a matter of time. I think the tariffs brought it out faster and they magnified the problem. But I think this was a problem that existed far beyond tariffs.
This was a systemic problem and we're going to cure that problem. And maybe to a large extent, we have because we've revealed it and we've revealed it very strongly. Yes, sir, please.
Thank you, Mr. President. So it seems China has made some serious missteps here in these negotiations. And Secretary Bessant said earlier, you may have goaded them into a tough position here. I'm wondering, are you in a way putting together a coalition against China in terms of trade here?
No, no. China, look, they're very capable and I don't blame China for what happened. I blame the people sitting right at this desk, right behind this desk or another desk. You get your choice of seven. I happen to pick the resolute. But I blame the people sitting behind in this chair, behind this desk for being stupid incompetent or not having courage.
This should have been done years ago. This should have been done before Obama, in all fairness. Not only Biden, Obama. It should have been done many years ago. This started with the World Trade Organization, which was owned by China. It was owned and paid for by China. They didn't even have to do things.
They considered them a nation that was undeveloped. They said they were a developing nation. Well, we're a developing nation too, if you think about it. Look at our inner cities, look at what's happened. I think we're starting from ground zero there, right? So we're a developing nation too. No, I know a lot of people take heat for saying it, but I blame the people sitting at this desk more than I blame China.
If China can get away with what they got away with, with taking hundreds of billions and trillions of dollars right out of our pocket because our people here were stupid, they were stupid people, maybe corrupt. I don't know. I don't know how you can be that stupid. How do you get to be president and you're stupid?
But they certainly weren't courageous and they allowed this to happen. And with Japan and with many other countries that took advantage of us. I mean, we had deficits with almost every country. I used to read these things. The first time I'd read them, I'd actually read the agreements, I'd say how could anybody agree to this stuff?
So certainly, they were rough and they were tough and they were smart and you can blame them, but I really blame the people that allowed them to do it. Because if you could read first grade, and you could read these agreements, you'd say these are terrible deals. I actually used to say, who would allow deals like this to be made for our country?
And maybe it's people that didn't care. Maybe it's people that weren't courageous. Maybe it's people that were corrupt, I don't know. But I blame those people more than I blame anybody else.
Mr. President, you've been very specific in saying that you would like the EU to purchase US energy. Is there something specific that you would like China to do?
Well, you'll be hearing about that. Yeah. There are a lot of things I'd like China to do.
Are there some examples?
There are a lot of things that I want China to do and I'll be telling China what that is, not you. I'll be telling China.
Mr. President, on Iran, you said the other day that if they do not agree to a potential nuclear deal, that it would be very dangerous for them? What specifically did you mean?
Well, they can't have a nuclear weapon.
Did you mean military action, though, if they don't agree?
Oh, if necessary? Absolutely, yeah.
Sir, do you have a deadline for these talks?
Yeah, I do. You're talking about with Iran?
Yes.
Yeah, I do.
Do have something definitive this weekend or do you see this as the start of a process?
It's a start.
Do you have a timeline?
We have a little time, but we don't have much time because we're not going to let them have a nuclear weapon. We can't let them have a nuclear weapon. And we're going to let them thrive. I want them to thrive. I want Iran to be great. The only thing they can't have is a nuclear weapon. They understand that.
The people are so incredible in Iran and they're so smart. They're very smart people and they're in a rough situation, rough regime, but they understand and the leaders understand. And I'm not asking for much. I just, they can't have a nuclear weapon. And I've said that and I was a little bit surprised because when the election was rigged, I figured they'd get the weapon because with me, they were broke.
They were broke. They had no money because of the sanctions. Nobody could buy oil. We did that to Venezuela just recently and we'll do it to other countries if we have to. I want to see Russia and Ukraine make a deal. They got to make a deal. When schools get blown up and bad things happen like I'm hearing about, it's no good.
I hope we're going to make a deal with Russia and Ukraine. But with Iran, yeah, if it requires military, we're going to have military. Israel will obviously be very much involved in that. They'll be the leader of that, but nobody leads us. We do what we want to do.
[Inaudible] on the talks?
Say?
When would the talks need to conclude before you might [Inaudible]
I can't really be specific, but when you start talks, you know if they're going along well or not. And I would say the conclusion would be when I think they're not going along well, so that's just a feeling.
Mr. President, on the subject of US troops stationed in Europe, do you have any plans to reduce the number of US troops in Europe or in other NATO countries?
Well, it could. I mean, it depends. We pay for military over in Europe. We don't get reimbursed by much, South Korea too. So it will be one of the things we discuss. That's unrelated to trade, but I think we'll make it part of it because it makes sense. It'd be nice to wrap it all up in one package for each country.
It's nice and clean and we have plenty of law firms. These are great law firms that we signed with, the best. And I think part of the way I'll spend some of the money that we're getting from the law firms, in terms of their legal time, will be, if we can do it, I think we can do it, using these great law firms to represent us with regard to the many, many countries that we'll be dealing with.
We have good lawyers representing us, but we want to have good lawyers. And these are considered the best lawyers in the world, right, I mean consider the best in the world. I don't know. They just went off a little bit.
Mr. President, two questions. On Iran. Do you have an update on who will be participating or conducting these conversations? Will [Inaudible] be there on Saturday for these direct talks? And on China, some economists are saying that right now is technically an embargo on China with 125 percent tariffs. Are you concerned of escalation beyond the trade war with China?
No, I'm not concerned. I think President Xi is a very smart guy and I think we'll end up making a very good deal for both. But we've been treated so badly for so many years. Again, we allowed that to happen. We've been treated so badly for so many years. But no, I don't expect that. I think President Xi is one of the very smart people of the world and I don't think he'd allow that to happen.
And we're very powerful. This country is very powerful. Let me tell you, it's far more powerful than people understand. We have weaponry that nobody has any idea what it is and it is the most powerful weapons in the world that we have, more powerful than anybody even -- not even close. So nobody's going to do that, but I think that, if that's what you're referring to, maybe it's not, but just in terms of basic escalation, which is what you said.
No, I think that President Xi is a man who knows exactly what has to be done. He's a very smart man. He loves his country. I know that for a fact. I know him very well and I think he's going to want to get to a deal. I think that's going to happen. We'll get a phone call at some point and it'll be off to the races.
It will be a great thing for them. It will be a great thing for us. It's going to be a great thing for the world and for humanity.
Do you have plans to meet with Putin in Saudi Arabia.
Yeah, at some point, I would. Yeah. At some point. We'll have to see. I mean, we have to get there. Right now, we got to get there. In the meantime, they're losing 2,500 on average, young people every single week. Think of that, 2,500 people a week. It's not even conceivable. We got to get there fast. Just a couple more.
Yes?
[Inaudible] to increase tariffs on China even more before they come to the table or give you a call?
I can't Imagine it. No, I can't imagine it.
[Inaudible]
I don't think so. I don't think I'll have to do it. I don't think we'll have to do it more. We calculated it very carefully. By the way, when you hear 100, a lot of a lot of people charged much more than that. Canada charges much more than that to our farmers, our dairy farmers. Many people charge much more than 100, or 125 in this case, but it's still a significant number.
No, I don't see that. Go ahead. Yeah, please.
Yeah, Mr. President, so do you think some of your tariff critics would prefer to see the United States go through turmoil than to actually see it succeed just because they are your policies?
You mean just leave the tariffs the way they are now and just relax, right?
Yeah.
Some people have said that. Look, again we're making, it will be soon much more than $2 billion a day. That's not the worst thing that I've ever heard. So yeah, some people say that, but we look at the other side too. I think as the United States, we have an obligation to look also at the other side. We want what's good for everyone.
I mean, it's America first, but we also want to make sure there's a world that can live and live happily and all of that. And so that's the way I look -- no, but there are people that say look where we are now, I've been in worse positions in my life than making $2 billion a day plus, plus, right? It's really plus, plus.
Thank you very much, everybody.
Thank you, press. Thank you, press. Headed out.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you very much.
[Inaudible] the markets are what really changed your mind when it came to [Inaudible]
The markets right now are extremely good. Thank you. Thank you, everybody.
Thank you. Thank you, press. Thank you. Thank you, guys.",7,you all set yes sir thank you very much appreciate it we just had a wonderful meeting with the greatest race car drivers in the world and some really spectacular people that won the indy for the last i guess for the last four years or last two years and roger penske is so incredible and the daytona winners and the daytona hour champions so it was really great to see him and to see those cars those cars are incredible so there s a lot of winning out there and we re having a good day in the stock market as you can see an all time record day and hopefully it continues i think it should our country is stronger than it s ever been and somebody had to do that we had to take the medicine we had to go through the operation and that s what we ve been through and a lot of presidents would not have done it no president would have done it i think but it had to be done and i just want to thank my team this team here and lots of others and scott and howard have been incredible and for energy there s nobody like this man and for the roads and highways you ve done well sean so we appreciate it very much appreciate it and if we could let s see we re signing a lot of executive orders and some ambassadors have been approved and we re going to start that process right now we re honored to have gretchen whitmer from michigan great state of michigan and she s really done an excellent job and a very good person and we re working on the selfridge as you know the air base we re trying to get the air base open keep it open i think gretchen if you re there and matt hall the speaker of the house of michigan and he s been fantastic as the speaker i appreciate it we won the state matt we did and you helped me a lot i did and you made me many speaker so thank you mr president that s good too and gretchen i think everybody knows so we re working on that very hard and i think we ll come home with a winner for michigan ok i just spoke with the secretary of defense sometimes we call him the secretary of war it used to be called the secretary of war they changed it when we became a little bit politically correct but i think we re in great shape we re going to be in great shape so thank you very much for being here thank you very much matt congratulations great job so we ll start with the first orders and i think we have one for a man named mike huckabee does anyone know mike huckabee yes sir he s going to be a great ambassador to israel and they re thrilled to have him that i can tell you go ahead yes sir so the senate confirmed governor huckabee to be your next ambassador to israel earlier today that s his commission as ambassador and then we also have a transmittal letter to the president of israel requesting that he accept governor huckabee s or excuse me ambassador huckabee s credentials he s going to be fantastic he s going to bring home the bacon even though bacon isn t too big in israel this is the third letter i had to clear that up well said ok thank you sir congratulations to mike to mike huckabee yeah next sir this is a big one as you ve consistently identified restoring our maritime dominance as a nation is very important from shipbuilding to having a merchant marine that s capable of supporting american military efforts really up and down the line restoring maritime dominance has been a priority of this administration this executive order which was prepared primarily by your national security council staff and national security advisor walt has a number of very significant policy steps all aimed at restoring american maritime dominance and ensuring that we have the shipbuilding capacity and ability to compete globally both militarily and in the civilian space as well and that could be a good one for michigan too because we re going to be spending a lot of money on shipbuilding we re way way way behind we used to build a ship a day and now we don t do a ship a year practically and we have the capacity to do it so we ll talk to you about that ok matt think about that matt s a natural ok shipbuilding that s a good one ok thank you thank you sir the next executive order relates to defense procurement our current defense procurement process has been criticized by many folks on both sides of the aisle as being too slow too slow to adapt to new and changing technologies not delivering the sorts of weapons and systems that our warfighters need in order to compete on the battlefields of the future so with this executive order we re going to be modernizing the procurement structure the department of defense uses to allow it to more quickly adapt to changing circumstances around the world and we re also going to be launching a review of existing procurement programs to ensure that we re getting value for the money and to ensure that we re getting the best possible systems in the field and which are currently horrible i ll tell you they re horrible that process is ridiculous what they do they get the highest price and not even good looking equipment and we re changing it we re going to change it to the best so this is very important and i want to say hello to brooke hi sir well look at brooke she got the cost of eggs down percent percent governor we have somebody that s done a great job at department of agriculture and kristi noem who perhaps a few of you have heard of she has done the most unbelievable job as somebody that s watching over our country at the border and with tom homan and your whole staff of tremendous people so thank you thank you mr president who would think that she s she is meant for that job huh she s meant for it i just saw you there both thank you very much thank you ok we ll do it later please thank you sir lastly in the defense space one persistent issue that we ve had in terms of the issue of foreign defense sales that we re unable to provide weapon systems in a reliable effective way to key allies of ours and a key driver of that is inefficiencies and inconsistencies with the process by which we approve foreign military sales so this executive order is going to direct your department of defense department of state and other relevant departments and agencies to rework our system of foreign defense sales to ensure that we can provide equipment creating american jobs and providing obviously revenue to american defense manufacturers but provide key military equipment to our key allies in a reliable effective way ok that s good all very important ok because our budget is just about approved and it s a big budget and we want to spend the money properly get the best equipment in the world we rebuilt our military during my first term rebuilt it entirely beautiful and then some was given away to afghanistan so stupidly the most embarrassing day in the history of our country i think but we have to fix it up a little bit and that s what we re going to do we re going to do a good job of it too thank you next up sir we have a series of executive orders and a memorandum all relating to deregulation which has obviously been a major priority of your administration the first of these is an executive order the biden administration launched what you ve called a war on showers they had certain regulations that basically killed the water pressure of showers and other water appliances you can say it go ahead what are the appliances i mean it s everything sir inaudible dishwashers toilets sinks um but the showerheads are a huge deal there s no water you don t get water it s ridiculous so with this executive order we re effectively going to be reversing that set of regulations to ensure that americans have choice in the consumer market if they want a low flow showerhead they can buy one if they want a real deal showerhead they should have the ability to get one they don t nobody wants it you buy a new house you pay a lot of money and the developers you re not allowed to do anything more they put restrictions on they used to have a restrictor where you could take it out but now they weld it in and you take a shower or wash your hands whatever you do including dishwashers where no water comes out but you wash your hands and in my case i like to take a nice shower to take care of my beautiful hair i have to stand under the shower for minutes until it gets wet it comes out drip drip drip it s ridiculous and what you do is you end up washing your hands five times longer so it s the same water and we re going to open it up so that people can live and we re going to hopefully have congress approve it so it s memorialized we re going to try and get all of these things including straws a little things like straws we did straws a month ago where the paper straws were melting they were dissolving they weren t working well and we went back to the plastic straws we re going to get congress to memorialize just about everything we ve done here because most of it is common sense but the water is horrible when you go into a new anytime you see a new faucet you know it s going to be a long wash of the hands and so we re changing it it s a big deal i did it in the first administration biden came in and his first week and he had no idea what he was doing but somebody told him to do it and his first week he put the restrictions on all the bathroom utilities even in areas that have so much water they don t know what to do with it you see those areas all the time with the flooding so we re doing that and we re going to get all of the things that you ve seen i think we set a record we re up to almost hundred amendments nobody s ever done that we re going to get them approved by congress so they re memorialized and we look forward to doing that very important and congress is going to start working on it as soon as we get the big beautiful deal done the big beautiful deal is important the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country that s important ok ok is that ok good inaudible inaudible a good shower it s amazing we rate the signatures that was a inaudible this is another executive order relating to deregulation sir there are a lot of regulations on the books that either promote monopoly directly or prevent new market entrants from entering into a given market the net effect of that is very negative for consumers so what this executive order is going to do is direct your departments and agencies to work with the ftc with the attorney general with the department of justice to ensure that the regulations we have on the books don t function as anti competitive barriers to new market entrants the net effect of all of that is going to hopefully be market forces that that redound to the benefit of consumers and ordinary americans as opposed to monopolistic businesses i said yesterday he was a great great student at harvard before it went bad it s gone really bad now i heard they re teaching their students mathematics basic mathematics can you believe it so what does that mean they re allowing people in they can t add two and two what s going on at harvard i went to law school there sir and it was pretty liberal when i was there but it s gone way off the deep end in recent years i don t know if you read that they re teaching them basic mathematics people that got accepted to harvard how come they got accepted they don t have mathematics and we re holding back $ billion can we believe we give harvard $ billion and we re holding back columbia we re holding back a lot of the schools because they were woke and they ve hurt a lot of people ok thank you thank you sir ok there are a large number of regulations on the books these are regulations that are currently in effect that we believe blatantly violate the law blatantly violates supreme court precedent that otherwise are just blatantly illegal so what this presidential memorandum does basically just directs the heads of your departments and agencies to follow the law and to cease enforcing regulations that are blatantly illegal or unconstitutional that s a big deal it s really very important that we get these memorialized yes sir congress very important for the long haul right yes sir this is the last of our deregulatory eos for the day this is zero based regulatory budgeting the idea here is that over time regulations accumulate on the books and in the federal register and people aren t taking a close detailed look at what s on the books and clearing them out as times change or as regulations become dated or ineffective what this executive order is going to require is each of your departments and agencies to scrutinize on a continuing rolling basis all of the regulations they actually have on the books and sunset those that either no longer serve a purpose or the departments and agencies can t identify a specific reason for keeping them active ok ok thank you sir sir you ve taken action against a number of law firms that have in one way or another been involved in the weaponization of government or actions of lawfare one of those law firms is susman godfrey similar to what we ve done previously with other law firms this is an executive order that takes certain measures against susman godfrey to ensure that they can t access government resources government buildings scrutinizing certain aspects of their practices as a law firm given their previous activities and we ve signed with many law firms the ones that we thought were inappropriate and they ve all agreed to pay let s say $ million they went for some pretty big numbers i guess we have a total what do we have what s the total about what s the total right now steve about would you say getting close to probably $ million $ million now i would think multiple at $ million some at $ million so the numbers are adding up we re going to be close to a billion soon one at $ million $ million millions of dollars an hour but they don t admit guilt remember that they don t admit guilt and we have another five to go i think five of them and this one is just we re just starting a process with this one yes sir all right because there were some very bad things that happened with these law firms and this firm was very involved in the election misconduct weren t they all involved in the election misconduct i think they were all involved yes anyway so they went from $ million to $ million and most of them were at about $ million right all right thank you thank you sir the next presidential memorandum we have for you relates to miles taylor you may recall that miles taylor served in the department of homeland security during your previous administration in his capacity with the department of homeland security he leaked classified information he wrote a book under the pseudonym anonymous making outrageous claims both about your administration and about others in it what this presidential memorandum is going to do one it s going to strip any act of clearance that he has in light of his past activities involving classified information it s also going to order the department of justice to investigate his activities to see what else might come up in that context given his egregious behavior during your previous administration and i had no idea who this guy was i had no idea i saw him on cnn or one of them i guess cnn a lot he d be on all the time saying that the president this the president i had no idea it s like in this office you have a lot of young people and they re here i ll see them for two minutes and i assume he was in the office but i barely remember him i barely remember him it was somebody that went out and wrote a book and said all sorts of terrible things that were all lies and it was like he was this gentleman or that gentleman like i dealt with him all the time i had no idea who this guy i said who the hell is miles taylor and he made a living on going on cnn talking about the president and i think what he did he wrote a book anonymous said all sorts of lies bad things and i think it s a traitor it s like spying he walks into the office he s supposed to be sitting here a lot of people i ll be here and they ll be people standing in the room they ll be oftentimes young people in the office i assume he was one of them at least but i didn t know anything about him and he wrote a book anonymous and i always thought it was terrible and now we have a chance to find out whether or not it was terrible but it was a work of fiction and a lot of publicity he got himself a nice job with cnn or one of them and i think we have to do something about it you can t have that happen if that happens to other presidents it wouldn t be sustainable for other presidents i seem to be able to sustain but if that happened to other presidents i mean it s just unfair and if it was a democrat president i d say that s a terrible thing a thing like that can happen that s a terrible thing and it s time to find out whether or not somebody can do that can they write a book about very confidential meetings because they happen to be one of a lot of people in a room and they go out and write a book and worse than that call it anonymous like it s a big deal and everybody saying who is it who is it who is it then it was found out who he was a long time later and he got a lot of publicity off that one he s like a promoter but we re going to find out whether or not somebody is allowed to do that i think it s a very important case and i think he s guilty of treason if you want to know the truth but we ll find out and i assume we re recommending this to the department of justice yes sir ok good terrible guy similarly sir christopher krebs the former head of cisa this is a man who weaponized his position against free speech in the election context and the context of covid this is another it s a similar presidential memorandum to the one you just signed it addresses his access to government existing clearances he might have and further instructs your department of justice other aspects of your government to investigate some of the malign acts that he participated in while he was still head of cisa this is another one i don t know that i met him i m sure i met him but i didn t know him and he came out right after the election which was a rigged election a badly rigged election we did phenomenally in that election look what happened to our country because of it open borders millions of people coming into our country russia and ukraine that would have never happened october th would have never happened afghanistan the way that they withdrew with dead but so many killed actually i mean so many killed outside of the soldiers hundreds of people killed and maybe i don t know never mentioned but i mentioned it or people so badly injured the legs the arms blown off the face and this is all because of an incompetent group of people that preceded us and that would have never happened and this guy krebs was saying oh the election was great it was great well it s been proven that it was not only not great when you look at all these lawyers and law firms that are signing giving us hundreds of millions of dollars it was proven by so many different ways in so many different forms from the legislature s not approving to the intelligence agents that worked from all of the different scamming operations it was a very corrupt election they used covid to cheat and we re going to find out about this guy too because this guy s a wise guy he said we would prove this is the most secure election in the history of our country no this was a disaster and frankly we should go to paper ballots same day voting voter id and one other thing you should get a little certificate that says you re a citizen of our country you get a citizen piece of paper that says you re a citizen before you can vote but you want voter id and you want paper ballots and you really want same day voting if you don t have same day voting they decide to change the air conditioner oh we re fixing the air let s move all these boxes we ll bring them back in a few days and then they don t bring back those boxes we got to have safe elections we have to have borders ideally we have to have a free press which we don t have we don t have a free press we have a very dishonest press it s an honor we re going to find out whether or not he was right this was a disgraceful election and this guy sat back saying well i m a member like he s a republican or something and almost right from the beginning and he s tried to make the case that this election was a safe election i think he said this is the safest election we ve ever had and yet every day you read in the papers about more and more fraud that s discovered he s the fraud he s a disgrace so we ll find out whether or not it was a safe election and if it wasn t he s got a big price to pay and he s a bad guy he s another one i have no idea who he is krebs had no idea who he is i m sure he was in the room at some point just like you re all in the room but i have no idea who he was so thank you very much those last two are very important i think for the country thank you sir and lastly we just have three proclamations these are the sorts of things that most presidents use an autopen for you obviously don t like using the autopen much if at all the first of these is national former prisoner of war recognition day this is one that you did in each of i believe each of the years of your previous administration it recognizes former prisoners of war more generally this proclamation is written uh to acknowledge the great steps you ve made both in this administration and your previous administration on behalf of veterans homeless veterans others who have suffered in that way and basically stating that it s a priority of your administration to ensure that veterans and homeless veterans are cared for properly good and you know what they ought to find out who was using that autopen because whoever that person was he or she was like the president of the united states and i m against autopens i think autopens are not a good thing especially when you re talking about documents like we re signing today if he can t sign then he can t be president it s pretty simple let s see whether or not he could sign but i think that should be tested i really think that should be tested it s another one and you may think about it because how can a man that did he really know that when they gave all false information on the council i mean the whole unselect committee of political lunatics they destroyed all the information you can t get any information they went for like a year and a half almost two years screaming and ranting and raving democrats plus two worse than democrats you had cheney liz cheney and crying adam kinzinger crying adam every time i looked at him he was crying the guy was a crier but you can t do that you just can t do that so we re going to find out a lot i think we re going to find out a lot these last three or four have been very they ve been very very interesting we ll see what happens yes sir but i don t think a president should be allowed to use an autopen when they re signing very important legislation i think a president should sign it not use an autopen and we re going to find out whether or not he knew what the hell he was doing i m sure at this point he ll say i signed it they ll tell him what to say but to give pardons to people that destroyed all the information if you destroyed information on a civil case just a civil case not a criminal case a civil case they put you in jail for that and they found out that pelosi was the one that was in charge of the security of the capitol she knew all about it and she admitted her guilt to her daughter who was a movie documentary person i m sure her daughter is not too happy about that i m sure crazy nancy s not too happy but we found out all the things everything and we go for the information sir we ve destroyed all of that information if i ever destroyed it i wouldn t be sitting here right now i guarantee you that i d be sitting someplace else so i think it s something that we should really look at because that s so important the whole concept of an autopen because autopens are run by somebody whoever ran the autopen was president of the united states and i would be willing to bet that biden didn t know probably didn t know anything about any of it very dangerous very dangerous so you re going to check that out right yes sir we re working on it right now sir this is just another proclamation sir declaring national crime victims rights week you ve obviously made it a major priority of your administration to track down and at times deport criminals who have committed violence on our streets who have victimized so many people this is an annual proclamation that hopefully gets americans to remember that when crimes occur there are real victims there are real people who are affected and there are people who suffer as a result ok it s very important thank you i just want to add so we re working very hard with the democrats the governor with matt hall with a lot of transportation sean and all of the people trying to keep selfridge air force base open strong thriving and i think we re going to be successful governor i think we ll be very successful that we ve gotten some good feedback from pete hegseth and department of defense and they re talking about f s they re talking about f s etc it s a great piece of property it s a great location and it s a great state so i think we re going to come back with a very good answer we re also working on a certain fish that s taken over a beautiful lake called michigan right and that s a tough one that s a tough one do you want to just talk about that sure mr president yeah first of all i want to thank you for caring so much about michigan we ve been working a long time we couldn t get joe biden to do anything about either one of these issues particularly selfridge air force base it ll be critical to michigan s economy and our security when you re able to deliver us another mission there but on the asian carp for years when obama was there we could never get anyone to do anything about this invasive species that s going to destroy our great lakes you know how important recreational fishing and so much of that is to our state because of your work we re hopeful that we ll get a solution there and we ll get that barrier built so we can protect our great lakes so thank you mr president and they re very powerful fish i mean i see them they jump out of the water they jump at the fishermen i mean i ve never seen anything like it and has this gotten into any of the other lakes yet because you would think it would be pretty easy because they re all sort of connected governor it s why we re working so hard to make sure that you know we work with the army corps and erect a barrier so that the asian carp can t get into lake michigan it ll devastate the ecosystem the economy tourism and it s percent of the world s fresh water is in the great lakes mr president which is why it s so important that as a nation we protect the pristine waters we better stop that now yeah and you know all of a sudden i assume the lakes are all interconnected right so at some point they re going to be in the other lakes and so we re going to work hard on that i spoke with the army corps of engineers and they have a method it s a pretty gruesome method but it s a method and i think they know what to do so we re going to work on that very hard and thank you governor very much it s sort of a bipartisan thing when you get right down to it it s a very expensive thing actually costs a lot i looked at the numbers i said wow but we have to save lake michigan because these fish they eat everything in their way including the other fish they eat everything are people endangered by the fish i mean they re going to eat all the fish there we won t be able to fish anymore and that s a big deal in lake michigan there s a lot of fishing recreation so it s going to be a problem there but you re right it s bipartisan sir but you re the one taking action on these issues we couldn t get biden to do it on selfridge this thing has been delayed for what years where we were trying to do it it started under obama where we were trying to do it he wouldn t do anything about it so we appreciate you paying so much attention to this and taking action sir well i would and the governor in all fairness called me about it and i had seen it and she called me and john james called me and we spoke with your office and i want to put that down really is bipartisan it s great to see it actually it s great to see that and that includes selfridge too and we re going to get it done and we ll all stand there together and cut a ribbon ok gretchen good that s good thank you very much thank you i m glad you brought it up and i m glad you brought it up matt appreciate it and i know you two get along pretty well right yeah about percent of the time all right good we ll have something to celebrate pretty soon so i m pretty sure about that ok thank you thank you thank you gretchen thank you very much ok do you have any questions mr president where does the tiktok deal stand given what we ve seen we know the tariffs in china well it s moving along but obviously i would say right now china is not exactly thrilled about signing it we have a deal with some very good people some very rich companies that would do a great job with it but we re going to have to wait to see what s going to happen with china inaudible no it s on the table very much i think china s going to want to do it actually mr president can you explain more of what you believe is the end game with china are you waiting for president xi to blink how do you think this is all going to be resolved no look for years we ve been ripped off and taken advantage of by china and others in all fairness but by china that s the big one and it s just one of those things you know we re making $ billion a day right now in this country $ billion a day with tariffs and they were making $ billion a day we ll be making more now when you see what happened today i don t know if it s still there i looked an hour ago but we were up like close to points nobody s ever seen a day like that i think that s a record isn t it fellas definitely is that a record who would have thought we were going to have a record like that after watching but because the geniuses of the world they get it our country is very strong we were left a very very weakened country both economically financially because of all of the tariffs and all of the other companies just raiding us and ripping us off and also at the border where million people are allowed to come in many of those people were criminals but the people that do this for a living some of them are very smart and some of them aren t smart at all but these guys are very smart and my group is very smart my whole group is smart and you ve done so amazing on the boarder i read the other day that there were nine people and hundreds of thousands two years ago with biden and we had nine we had it down to nine and they were all let in for medical reasons they were in bad shape we let them in for medical reasons not even for anything else so you ve been amazing but that s a big thing i think it s one of the greatest problems i ve never seen anything like it open borders the whole world was emptied out prisons from all over the world from the congo in africa from africa to asia a lot in south america but it wasn t just south america prisons emptied out and i said it outside with the drivers before but el salvador has been amazing the job that the president has done he s coming to see me next week and we look forward to that but that s really been amazing yes mr president the eu also announced increases in tariffs today why not treat that s bad timing for them that s bad timing why not they said they didn t put them in no they threatened them but they picked a later which our expectation is it s going to be later still ok good i m glad that they held back you said you were watching the markets if this was the strategy all along to bring them to the table why did you instruct or advise or maybe they did it on their own some of your top aides to say this is not a negotiation to hold the line that they were going to hold the line that you were not going to change your mind well a lot of times it s not a negotiation until it is and that happens and i said outside that you have to have flexibility to do it right and that s what we have we brought everybody to the table and it may not be a negotiation it may not last i mean you know things may be as that i think are not fair to us look we ve been ripped off by essentially everybody for years this is not just a new thing and roger penske just left he s a great gentleman a great man actually and he said no other president would have had the guts to do this and i believe that s right they wouldn t have done it they should have done this a long time ago a long time ago they should have done i started it with china i took in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and taxes from china in my first term and we had the greatest economy we were up percent on the stock market that was the greatest ever in the history of our country but it had to be done something that had to be done mr president thank you so much which countries will be negotiating first do you have any criteria because for example brazil and the uk they do not have deficits with the us they have a surplus they do not have a surplus they have deficits with the us so what is the criteria and also would you consider talking or meeting with xi jinping oh sure i would he s a friend of mine i like him president xi i like him i respect him but they haven t treated our country right sure i d meet with him on the other countries japan is here and south korea is here and others are here and we re trying to see them from what i hear it s much more than i said plus so many everybody wants to make a deal actually and we want to do what s right for our country we also want to do what s right for the world the world is important i mean it s the world right and i think we re going to make a lot of people very happy and i think investing in the united states of america will be the greatest investment that anybody s ever made mr president inaudible see the sectoral tariffs so the pharmaceuticals steel is that something you re still considering moving forward will yeah well i will be because we want them coming back we realized during covid that we don t make our drugs and our pharmaceuticals in this country so i realized that and it was a big realization we had to go to china to get drugs we had to go to other places i won t even mention the names but we had to go to other places we don t make it and that s because we let them leave and now if they want to come back we re going to put tariffs on the pharmaceutical companies and they re going to all want to come back they re going to come back i m not going to pay them any money like biden with the chip deal that chip deal was horrible they give billions and billions of dollars to chip companies all they have is money they have so much money and they give billions of dollars and they re just going to keep the money they re not going to spend it the only thing that s going to bring them back is you say we have a barrier you have to pay percent or percent or percent and if they have to pay that they re going to say we re not going to pay that we re going to build here and that s what happened we have the biggest most prestigious chip company in the world spending $ billion to $ billion billion think of that billion dollars to build essentially one massive plant it will be one of the largest plants in the world and we re going to get them very quickly we re going to get them energy we re going to get them the electricity they need and the energy that they need and it will be approved by lee zeldin a total professional and it will be approved very quickly and they ll get their zoning very quickly they ll have everything done in a matter of months thank you sir you ve procured a record amount of private sector investments since your election $ trillion you talked about the importance of all that can you talk about how these investments will have a positive impact on families who felt like the previous economy left them behind and why your executive orders on coal yesterday is so important given the amount of manufacturing that you re ushering back in well thank you which is correct we have i would say more than $ trillion now of investment coming in apple is coming in for $ billion alone we have other companies coming in with massive numbers we have car companies that are coming in we ve never seen anything like it maybe in the s or s or something but we ve never seen anything like it they had three plants canceled in mexico not that we want to hurt mexico but we re for us and that s what my job is it s not to take care of other countries but i want to help other countries as much as i can but we have to take care of america first and it s about america first so we have many many companies coming in that would have never come in if we didn t win the election and then put the tariffs on and they re coming in because when they build in the united states there are no tariffs you don t have to pay any tariffs so instead of paying percent or percent but it could go a lot higher in some of the industries so we have steel mills right now that are raging the steel industry has gone if i didn t put the tariffs on steel because china was dumping massive amounts of steel in my first term and i put tariffs on it i saved the steel industry but now it s going to thrive maybe like never before i mean if you go back to us steel from years ago it s incredible it s the number one company in the world for a long time that s why we don t want to see it go to japan and we love japan but us steel is a very special company we don t want it to go to japan or any other place so we re working with them and i don t know if they need any money now i ll be honest with you they hit gold they hit gold because if you look at it they have such orders for steel now it s incredible what s going on in our country is incredible with respect to plants so we lost plants and factories from the beginning of nafta the worst trade deal ever made in the history of this world but certainly in the history of trade there s never been a worse trade deal we were able to cancel that we had to get approval from congress it was like it was a disastrous curse because you you had to go to congress to get it terminated you couldn t just terminate it because it was a bad deal and you had people in congress that didn t want to do it because they had other reasons maybe bad reasons they re mostly not there anymore those people but it s amazing what s happened i appreciate that question because it s an incredible i don t think we ve ever seen anything like it $ trillion and it s much more than that because these are places that we know $ trillion is unheard of i never looked at the biden numbers but you could go a whole year and it was peanuts everybody was leaving they weren t coming in they were leaving and that means jobs are leaving and so we re not playing games we re going to make this country greater than ever before thank you for that question mr president it seems that china let her just do that and we ll get you oh yeah absolutely thanks for the past few days we ve heard from this administration no pause was this idea of doing a pause did that just come about this morning can you tell us exactly what came into consideration for you and your advisors for a period of time i wouldn t say this morning over the last few days i ve been thinking about it i ve been dealing with scott with howard with some other people that are very professional and i think it probably came together early this morning fairly early this morning just wrote it up we didn t have the use of we didn t have access to lawyers or we just wrote up we wrote it up from our hearts right it was written from the heart and i think it was well written too but it was written from the heart it was written as something that i think was very positive for the world and for us and we don t want to hurt countries that don t need to be hurt and they all want to negotiate the only problem is you can only do so many at one time we want to do it right we want to get it right we want to take care of them but we have to take care of our country but this was something certainly we ve been talking about for a period of time and we decided to pull the trigger and we did it today and we re happy about it i didn t know it would have that kind of an impact but i think have the biggest increase in the history of the stock market that s pretty good you re almost if you keep going you re going to be back to where it was four weeks ago but it was a sick market four weeks ago because this trade was sick it was only a question of time i don t blame the tariffs i think the tariffs just sort of magnified what was happening it was sick biden allowed these people to get away with murder biden allowed china to just take advantage of us we had like $ trillion deficit with china trillion dollar deficit so that was going to only be a matter of time i think the tariffs brought it out faster and they magnified the problem but i think this was a problem that existed far beyond tariffs this was a systemic problem and we re going to cure that problem and maybe to a large extent we have because we ve revealed it and we ve revealed it very strongly yes sir please thank you mr president so it seems china has made some serious missteps here in these negotiations and secretary bessant said earlier you may have goaded them into a tough position here i m wondering are you in a way putting together a coalition against china in terms of trade here no no china look they re very capable and i don t blame china for what happened i blame the people sitting right at this desk right behind this desk or another desk you get your choice of seven i happen to pick the resolute but i blame the people sitting behind in this chair behind this desk for being stupid incompetent or not having courage this should have been done years ago this should have been done before obama in all fairness not only biden obama it should have been done many years ago this started with the world trade organization which was owned by china it was owned and paid for by china they didn t even have to do things they considered them a nation that was undeveloped they said they were a developing nation well we re a developing nation too if you think about it look at our inner cities look at what s happened i think we re starting from ground zero there right so we re a developing nation too no i know a lot of people take heat for saying it but i blame the people sitting at this desk more than i blame china if china can get away with what they got away with with taking hundreds of billions and trillions of dollars right out of our pocket because our people here were stupid they were stupid people maybe corrupt i don t know i don t know how you can be that stupid how do you get to be president and you re stupid but they certainly weren t courageous and they allowed this to happen and with japan and with many other countries that took advantage of us i mean we had deficits with almost every country i used to read these things the first time i d read them i d actually read the agreements i d say how could anybody agree to this stuff so certainly they were rough and they were tough and they were smart and you can blame them but i really blame the people that allowed them to do it because if you could read first grade and you could read these agreements you d say these are terrible deals i actually used to say who would allow deals like this to be made for our country and maybe it s people that didn t care maybe it s people that weren t courageous maybe it s people that were corrupt i don t know but i blame those people more than i blame anybody else mr president you ve been very specific in saying that you would like the eu to purchase us energy is there something specific that you would like china to do well you ll be hearing about that yeah there are a lot of things i d like china to do are there some examples there are a lot of things that i want china to do and i ll be telling china what that is not you i ll be telling china mr president on iran you said the other day that if they do not agree to a potential nuclear deal that it would be very dangerous for them what specifically did you mean well they can t have a nuclear weapon did you mean military action though if they don t agree oh if necessary absolutely yeah sir do you have a deadline for these talks yeah i do you re talking about with iran yes yeah i do do have something definitive this weekend or do you see this as the start of a process it s a start do you have a timeline we have a little time but we don t have much time because we re not going to let them have a nuclear weapon we can t let them have a nuclear weapon and we re going to let them thrive i want them to thrive i want iran to be great the only thing they can t have is a nuclear weapon they understand that the people are so incredible in iran and they re so smart they re very smart people and they re in a rough situation rough regime but they understand and the leaders understand and i m not asking for much i just they can t have a nuclear weapon and i ve said that and i was a little bit surprised because when the election was rigged i figured they d get the weapon because with me they were broke they were broke they had no money because of the sanctions nobody could buy oil we did that to venezuela just recently and we ll do it to other countries if we have to i want to see russia and ukraine make a deal they got to make a deal when schools get blown up and bad things happen like i m hearing about it s no good i hope we re going to make a deal with russia and ukraine but with iran yeah if it requires military we re going to have military israel will obviously be very much involved in that they ll be the leader of that but nobody leads us we do what we want to do inaudible on the talks say when would the talks need to conclude before you might inaudible i can t really be specific but when you start talks you know if they re going along well or not and i would say the conclusion would be when i think they re not going along well so that s just a feeling mr president on the subject of us troops stationed in europe do you have any plans to reduce the number of us troops in europe or in other nato countries well it could i mean it depends we pay for military over in europe we don t get reimbursed by much south korea too so it will be one of the things we discuss that s unrelated to trade but i think we ll make it part of it because it makes sense it d be nice to wrap it all up in one package for each country it s nice and clean and we have plenty of law firms these are great law firms that we signed with the best and i think part of the way i ll spend some of the money that we re getting from the law firms in terms of their legal time will be if we can do it i think we can do it using these great law firms to represent us with regard to the many many countries that we ll be dealing with we have good lawyers representing us but we want to have good lawyers and these are considered the best lawyers in the world right i mean consider the best in the world i don t know they just went off a little bit mr president two questions on iran do you have an update on who will be participating or conducting these conversations will inaudible be there on saturday for these direct talks and on china some economists are saying that right now is technically an embargo on china with percent tariffs are you concerned of escalation beyond the trade war with china no i m not concerned i think president xi is a very smart guy and i think we ll end up making a very good deal for both but we ve been treated so badly for so many years again we allowed that to happen we ve been treated so badly for so many years but no i don t expect that i think president xi is one of the very smart people of the world and i don t think he d allow that to happen and we re very powerful this country is very powerful let me tell you it s far more powerful than people understand we have weaponry that nobody has any idea what it is and it is the most powerful weapons in the world that we have more powerful than anybody even not even close so nobody s going to do that but i think that if that s what you re referring to maybe it s not but just in terms of basic escalation which is what you said no i think that president xi is a man who knows exactly what has to be done he s a very smart man he loves his country i know that for a fact i know him very well and i think he s going to want to get to a deal i think that s going to happen we ll get a phone call at some point and it ll be off to the races it will be a great thing for them it will be a great thing for us it s going to be a great thing for the world and for humanity do you have plans to meet with putin in saudi arabia yeah at some point i would yeah at some point we ll have to see i mean we have to get there right now we got to get there in the meantime they re losing on average young people every single week think of that people a week it s not even conceivable we got to get there fast just a couple more yes inaudible to increase tariffs on china even more before they come to the table or give you a call i can t imagine it no i can t imagine it inaudible i don t think so i don t think i ll have to do it i don t think we ll have to do it more we calculated it very carefully by the way when you hear a lot of a lot of people charged much more than that canada charges much more than that to our farmers our dairy farmers many people charge much more than or in this case but it s still a significant number no i don t see that go ahead yeah please yeah mr president so do you think some of your tariff critics would prefer to see the united states go through turmoil than to actually see it succeed just because they are your policies you mean just leave the tariffs the way they are now and just relax right yeah some people have said that look again we re making it will be soon much more than $ billion a day that s not the worst thing that i ve ever heard so yeah some people say that but we look at the other side too i think as the united states we have an obligation to look also at the other side we want what s good for everyone i mean it s america first but we also want to make sure there s a world that can live and live happily and all of that and so that s the way i look no but there are people that say look where we are now i ve been in worse positions in my life than making $ billion a day plus plus right it s really plus plus thank you very much everybody thank you press thank you press headed out thank you mr president thank you very much inaudible the markets are what really changed your mind when it came to inaudible the markets right now are extremely good thank you thank you everybody thank you thank you press thank you thank you guys
/Users/samantha/Desktop/speech text data/rollcall (3).csv,"Thank you very much. It's an honor to have a very, very special person. I've dealt with him for a long time, Benjamin Netanyahu, prime minister of Israel. And we had lunch together. We had meetings together along with his very capable staff. And I think we've come up to some pretty good solutions and conclusions.
And we'll be working a little bit after this, and then I assume you're going back home?
Yes, sir.
This is a quick stop, in and out, but we appreciate you being here and we are a friend of Israel, as you know. I would say that I'm, by far, the best president that Israel has ever even thought of seeing and it's an honor to be so -- and to be so thought of many friends in Israel, they are not in an easy area, it doesn't go easy, but we are helping them and, likewise, they've been helping us very much.
And so, we'll see how it all works out. But we had great discussions today, I think, on the obvious subject of Iran and also the less obvious of subject with respect to Israel and that's trade. And I think the prime minister is going to tell you a little bit about trade and what they're doing for the United States.
So, I want to thank you all for being here. Thank you very much and, Benjamin, thank you very much.
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Donald. Thank you. Mr. President, I want to first thank you for inviting me again to the White House. You've been a remarkable friend of the State of Israel. You stand by us. You're standing with us. You are a great, great champion of our alliance and you actually do the things that you say you do, and I think that people respect that enormously.
I certainly do and the people of Israel do, and I think the Jewish people do as well. We just saw your representative in the Department of Justice fighting anti-Semitism, standing up for Israel in international forums. I just want you to know from the heart, it's deeply, deeply appreciated. As you said, we had the opportunity to talk today about many subjects.
First, if I can mention tariffs, it's a subject of some interest today. I can tell you that I said to the president a very simple thing. We will eliminate the trade deficit with the United States. We intend to do it very quickly. We think it's the right thing to do. And we're going to also eliminate trade barriers, a variety of trade barriers that have been put up unnecessarily.
And I think Israel can serve as a model for many countries who ought to do the same. I recognize the position of the United States, it says, you know, we're allowing other countries to put tariffs on us, but we don't put tariffs on them. And you know, I'm a free trade champion and free trade has to be fair trade.
And I think that's basically the position that you have put forward, Mr. President. We are going to eliminate the tariffs and rapidly. I had the opportunity to speak to Secretary Lutnick yesterday. We talked about how we could affect this quickly and I hope to bring a solution very quickly. We're not talking about intentions.
We're not talking about just words; we're talking about results, and those results are going to come in. So, that's the first.
Thank you very much. That's very nice. Thank you.
Mr. President, what about the hostage deal?
Let him -- let him finish.
I'm finished [Inaudible]. We spoke about not only the hostages but about Gaza. The hostages obviously is a human story of an just unbearable agony. I speak to the families; I spoke to them yesterday. I spoke to another one when I was in Hungary before I came here. I speak to them every day and they're in agony.
The hostages are in agony, and we want to get them all out. Steve Witkoff, President Trump's very able representative, helped us get a deal that got 25 out. We're working now on another deal that we hope will succeed. And we're committed to getting all the hostages out but also eliminating the evil tyranny of Hamas in Gaza and enabling the people of Gaza to freely make a choice to go wherever they want.
I mean they should have that choice. And the president put forward a vision, a bold vision, which we discussed as well, including the countries that might be amenable and are amenable to accepting Palestinians of their free choice if they choose to go there. And I think that's the second thing that we discussed.
But the hostages came right on top. We also discussed the situation in Syria. We've had neighborly relations with Turkey that have deteriorated. And we don't want to see Syria being used by anyone, including Turkey, as a base for attack in Israel. Turkey is a country that has a great relationship with the United States.
The President has a relationship with the leader of Turkey. We discussed how we can avoid this conflict in a variety of ways, and I think we can't have a better interlocutor than the president of the United States for this purpose. And of course, we also discussed Iran. Look, we're both united in the goal that Iran does not ever get nuclear weapons.
If it can be done diplomatically in a full way, the way it was done in Libya, I think that would be a good thing. But whatever happens, we have to make sure that Iran does not have nuclear weapons. That's the end of my speech.
Mr. President --
[Crosstalk]
We are -- we're having direct talks with --
[Crosstalk]
-- wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, we're having direct talks with Iran. And they've started -- it'll go on Saturday. We have a very big meeting, and we'll see what can happen. And I think everybody agrees that doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious. And the obvious is not something that I want to be involved with or frankly that Israel wants to be involved with if they can avoid it. So, we're going to see if we can avoid it, but it's getting to be very dangerous territory.
And hopefully those talks will be successful, and I think it would be in Iran's best interests if they are successful. We hope that's going to happen. And we had just a lot of good talks on a lot of things. I appreciate very much what you said about the tariffs. We've been ripped off and taken advantage of by many countries over the years and can't do it anymore, just can't do it anymore.
We can't be the stupid people anymore. And it's all because of the people that sat in the seat right here, not your seat, but this seat, they allowed things to happen to our country that they shouldn't have allowed to happen on trade and other things. Many other things. I mean look at what's happened with our last president where he allowed millions of people to come into our country with an open border.
Who would want an open border? How stupid is that? But he allowed millions and millions of people. And of the millions, and I think it was 21 million people, but let's say three of them were serious criminals, serious murderers and drug dealers and gang members and people from jails, all the jails emptied out right into our country right along the open border on Mexico, generally the Mexico border.
They came in from Canada too, by the way, a lot. But generally speaking, on the southern border. And what a shame it is that we are now working very hard to get them out, get the criminals out, get the murderers out, the drug dealers, the mentally insane, get them out. They dropped the mentally insane in our country too.
And this was all done by the Biden administration. It's a disgrace that we have to work so hard. And then we have judges that try and protect these people, but they didn't protect us when the people were being let in. But to get them out is never easy with these people. So, I think we're doing a great job.
The border is the best it's ever been, even as strong as it was. I had a great solid border. I think it might even be tougher right now and stronger. So, people are coming into our country, but they're coming in legally. We have a legal process, and we have that moving along properly because we need people to come into our country, but we want people that can love our country and cherish our country.
So that's where we are and, with that, any questions?
[Crosstalk]
-- the market today and would you be open to a pause in tariffs to allow for negotiations?
Well, we're not looking at that. We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us and they're going to be fair deals. And in certain cases, they're going to be paying substantial tariffs. They'll be fair deals. As you know, I spoke this morning with the prime minister of Japan, and we had a very good conversation.
They're coming. And I said one thing -- you're going to have to open up your country because we sold no cars, like zero cars, in Japan and they sold millions of cars into our country. They don't really take our agriculture, a little bit of it, just to keep us slightly happy, but they don't take what they're supposed to be taking.
So, we have a great relationship with Japan. We're going to keep it that way, but they're coming in to meet and other countries are coming in. With China, as you know, against my statement, they put a 34 percent tariff on above what their ridiculous tariffs were already. And I said if that tariff isn't removed by tomorrow at 12:00, we're putting a 50 percent tariff on above the tariffs that we put on. So, they've gone for years, they've become a rich country because of people again that were in the White House that allowed this to happen.
Hundreds of billions of dollars a year they'd make on us on trade, and it shouldn't be that way. And I have a great relationship with President Xi, I hope it's going to stay that way. I have great respect for China, but they can't do this with just -- we're going to have one shot at this, and no other president is going to do this, what I'm doing.
And I'll tell you what, it's an honor to do it because we have been just destroyed, what they've done to our system.
You know, we have $36 trillion of debt for a reason and the reason is that people are allowed it to get that way, so we'll be talking to China. We'll be talking to a lot of different countries. And I think, if we can make a really fair deal and a good deal for the United States, not a good deal for other -- this is America first.
It's now America first. And we didn't put America first. We put America last. The people that were in the Oval Office, put America last and we're not going to stand for it. Yeah. Go ahead. Go ahead.
Two questions. Do you expect any of these deals to be made before April 9th? And secondly, there have been some mixed messages from your administration. You're talking about negotiations and yet others in your administration are saying that these tariffs are actually permanent. What is the actual --
Well, they can both be true.
There can be permanent tariffs and there can also be negotiations, because there are things that we need beyond tariffs. We need open borders. We almost had a deal with China, where we were going to open up China. It was almost done. Some of you remember it during my first term. And it was very disappointing.
We ended up making a great deal, $50 billion worth of product was sold, $50 billion. You'd like that in Israel. And I made that deal, but it wasn't the deal that I wanted. The deal that I wanted was that, plus they were going to open up China so that our companies could go into China and compete with other countries and China for a large number of people.
And at the very end, that deal was terminated and we went to a piece of the deal. And so there are a lot of things outside of tariffs, but tariffs are very important. But there are a lot of things like opening up countries that were totally closed. China's essentially a closed country. In fact, it is a closed country.
And what they do is they charge tariffs so that if you sell cars or if you sell anything, nobody's going to buy it because the price is out of control. But that's true with a lot of other countries also. So we're going to get fair deals and good deals with every country. And if we don't, we're going to have nothing to do with them.
They're not going to be allowed to participate in the United States.
[Crosstalk]
Hold it. Hold it, hold it, hold it. Relax. We have time. This gentleman has all day long.
Mr. President, many of -- thank you for the --
Go ahead.
Many Palestinian Americans who voted for you voted for you and not for Biden because you've promised them to end the war in Gaza.
Correct. I'm very honored by that vote too.
The war is still going on and there's no hostage deal. Do you have any update on that?
Well, I'd like to see the war stop, and I think the war will stop at some point that won't be in the too distant future. Right now we have a problem with hostages. We're trying to get the hostages out. We've got quite a few of them out, but it's a long process. It shouldn't be that long. We have a big problem that we've done -- I think I'll ask Pete to maybe talk about it for a second, because a lot of people are asking -- the Houthis, we've been very tough and very successful militarily.
We've really damaged them badly. These were people shooting down ships and other things, by the way, flying objects like airplanes and we've put a major hurt on the Houthis, which nobody's been able to do. We've really hit them hard, and they know it, and they don't know what to do. And it's every night, night after night, and we've gotten many of their leaders and their experts, their experts on missiles.
I mean, they actually make missiles. Nobody thought that, but they make missiles. It's highly sophisticated and they're very tough, but they've been very badly damaged. Nobody else was able to do that, but us. Pete, do you want to discuss that, please?
Yes, sir. It's been a bad three weeks for the Houthis and it's about to get worse. It's been a devastating campaign, whether it's underground facilities, weapons manufacturing, bunkers, troops in the open, air defense assets. We are not going to relent and it's only to get more unrelenting until the Houthis declare they will stop shooting at our ships.
And we've been very clear with the Iranians as well. They should not continue to provide support to the Houthis, and that message has been made very clear. So we have a lot more options and a lot more pressure to apply. And we know, because we see the reports, how devastating this campaign has been in them and we will not relent.
We have a great military. There's no military like our military. And despite Biden having given a lot, but nevertheless a pretty small piece, but it was a lot of our military away in Afghanistan. And one of the dumbest situations I think and maybe the most embarrassing situation We've ever been involved in, that short period of time in Afghanistan.
What a disgrace that was, but left a lot of our military behind. You see them in their annual parades, where they're parading trucks that are armor plated and different things that they can -- but it's many billions of dollars we left behind. But despite that, we have a tremendous military. That was a very small portion because we rebuilt the military during my first term.
And we have great things happening with our military. We also, essentially, approved a budget, which is in the facility. You'll like to hear this, of $1 trillion, $1 trillion. And nobody's seen anything like it. We have to build our military and we're very cost conscious, but the military is something that we have to build and we have to be strong because you got a lot of bad forces out there now.
So we're going to be approving a budget. And I'm proud to say, actually, the biggest one we've ever done for the military. We're cutting other things that were, under DOGE, but under a lot of other -- when you look at a woman getting $2 billion for environmental and it had nothing to do with environmental and they had $100 in the bank and they give her $2 billion.
Many, many of those cases, all that stuff is going to be cut out, but we are getting a very, very powerful military. We have things under order now, the likes of which we've never had before. We've never had the kind of aircraft, the kind of missiles, anything that we have ordered. And it's, in many ways, too bad that we have to do it because hopefully, we're not going to have to use it. But the military is very, very powerful and it's going to remain that way.
Go ahead, please. Please. Yes [Inaudible]
Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about Iran because this is the first time we hear that the US is having a direct contact with them. Is it possible to get some more information, at what level is the US --
High level, very high level. Yeah. We're dealing with the Iranians. We have a very big meeting on Saturday and we're dealing with them directly.
A lot of people say, oh, maybe you're going through surrogates or you're not dealing directly, you're dealing through other countries. No, we're dealing with them directly. And maybe a deal is going to be made. That would be great. It would be really great for Iran, I can tell you that. But hopefully, we're not going to have to get into that.
We are meeting very importantly on Saturday at almost the highest level and we'll see how it works out. Please.
How do you assure, Mr. President, that these tariffs don't drive US trading partners into the hands of the Chinese?
I'm not worried about it. I'm not worried about it. If they want to be in the hands of the US, they don't want to be in the hands of the Chinese. And the Chinese have turned out to be really, not very good at that. People that are with us, they're with us, but we cannot be taken advantage of any longer. I used to watch these deals for years.
I've been talking about it for years. I've been talking about it for 35 years, how our country is being ripped off. I mean, 30 years ago, it was Japan, then it was something else. Then it was another group. Then it was China. China's doing the best job of it, frankly. And it's just not going to happen, not going to happen.
Mr. President, [Inaudible] has said that they have offered zero for zero tariffs on cars and industrial goods. Is that not enough?
Well, the EU -- no, it's not. The EU has been very tough over the years. I always say, it was formed to really do damage to the United States in trade. That's the reason it was formed. It was formed with all of the countries from Europe. I guess, most of them, not all of them, but most of them and they formed together to create a little bit of a monopoly situation to create a unified force against the United States for trade.
So they have NATO, which is largely the same countries and they took advantage of us dollar wise and militarily until I got there. I was able to get $600 billion from NATO, where they paid NATO. Because most of these nations weren't even paying. We were paying for NATO. So we're paying them to guard them militarily and they're screwing us on trade.
So that's not a good combination. So now, it's really turned around. It's the opposite. And the European Union's been very bad to us. They don't take our cars, like Japan in that sense. They don't take our agricultural product. They don't take anything practically, and yet they send millions of cars in a year, Mercedes Benz, Volkswagen, BMWs.
They're sending millions and millions of cars into the US, but we don't have a car that's been sold to the European Union or other places, but let's go for the European Union and it's not going to be that way. It's got to be fair and reciprocal. It's got to be fair -- it's not fair. We have a deficit with the European Union of $350 billion and it's going to disappear fast.
And one of the reasons and one of the ways that that can disappear easily and quickly is they're going to have to buy our energy from us because they need it. They're going to have to buy it from us. They can buy it. We can knock off $350 billion in one week. They have to buy and commit to buy a like amount of energy and we have that -- you know, we have more energy than any country in the world.
I don't know if you know that. He knows everything, but the one thing he may not know we have more energy than any country in the world. We have more of every kind of energy, every form of energy from oil and gas to coal. And people talk about, I call it beautiful clean coal. As you know, Germany is opening up a coal plant a week.
They tried the windmills, and it didn't work. They tried all the other solutions, and they were ready to go out of business. Now they're doing a coal plant a week. China is now up to two coal plants. They're opening two major coal plants every single week in China, all over China and then we're not allowed to use coal.
Well, we have clean, beautiful coal more than anybody else. We have oil and gas, more than anybody else. We have the most energy of any country in the world including Saudi Arabia, including everybody by a lot. And I took it to number one -- we were number three and I took it to number one during my administration.
And the reason that we were hurt so badly and the reason that we went into such incredible inflation during Biden is energy. It was also their bad spending. But energy because they played around with this incredible thing that we had built, this administration had built, and the energy costs went through the roof.
And when that went up, everything else followed. Now if you look at what's happening, you're going to see this today, I said we're going to try and get groceries down, right, an old-fashioned term, but a beautiful term -- eggs. So, when I got in the press went absolutely crazy the first week. They said eggs have quadrupled in price.
I said I just got here, tell me about it. And Brooke Rollins and our team did a great job and eggs are down now 79 percent and they're all over the place. And this was a problem that somebody else would have taken a long time to cure. We have -- energy is down, we have interest rates are down, we have groceries, meaning food is down.
We have -- everything is down at levels that nobody ever thought possible. Wnergy looks like it's going to be in the $2.50 a gallon range and maybe below that for a car. So, for gasoline. So, we're really doing amazing. I mean, we're cutting prices because prices got so high, people couldn't live. I mean the prices for groceries, the prices for standard -- standard groceries, standard things were going through the roof, they couldn't live.
And now those prices are coming down, so call them groceries, but that's down. Energy is down and interest rates are down, everything's down. And the interest rates, the beauty there is when we refinance debt -- you know, debt has become such a big factor in this country. We're going to get -- we're going to start paying debt off with tariffs and other things.
But it's such a big factor because the interest rates so high. Well, now that's coming way down. So, our budget's going to look a lot better because interest costs are way down, and I guess I've done that.
[Crosstalk]
Many Israelis are watching you now on live show.
Good. I hope they like me.
[Crosstalk]
-- to getting the hostages out from the horrific captivity?
We are trying very hard to get the hostages out. We're looking at another ceasefire; we'll see what happens. But we want to get the hostages out. The Israeli people want the hostages out; more than anything they want the hostages out. This man is working very hard with us to do that. I mean, I don't know.
I hope he's being appreciated because he's been a great leader. He's working very, very hard on the hostages and many other things. And there are plenty of things you have to work on. It's a tough place in the world, isn't it?
I have a good partner.
Yeah, you do have a good partner and so do we. We're working very hard on the hostages.
[Crosstalk]
If you're going to negotiate a new deal with Iran, can you elaborate how it's going to be more effective than the JCPOA?
Well, I can't really say that, but I think it will be different and maybe a lot stronger. But they were so happy when we made that first deal because we did get a lot out. You know, I had people right in this office, this beautiful Oval Office. They came in, 10 people, hostages, you know that. And I said to them, so how was it? And the stories they told me. I mean as an example, I said to them, was there any sign of love?
You were there, 10 people, it's only 10, but it's pretty representative. Did the Hamas show any signs of like help or liking you? Did they wink at you? Did they give you a piece of bread extra? Did they give you a meal on the side? Like you know, you think of doing -- like what happened in Germany, what happened elsewhere.
People would try and help people that were in unbelievable distress. They said no. I said all of them. I said, did they ever wink at you like you'll be OK, you're going to be OK? No, they didn't do that. They'd slap us. The hatred is unbelievable. And the lives -- you know, they lived in a pipe, not really a tunnel, it was a pipe and they always thought they were suffocating, they were going to suffocate.
And then they'd open up the pipe and it was like 3.5 feet high. This isn't -- you know, we hear tunnel is bad, but pipes are worse and the stories I heard were incredible. But I just said, was there any sign of potential love or affection? And there were none whatsoever. It was amazing to me. There was nothing like, here, take this, it's a little extra meal or something.
They lived like hell. I don't know. They seem to be -- they were amazing to me because they seemed to be pretty normal. They weren't scarred, but I guarantee underneath they have to be scarred. And one was there for 356 days, another was there for about 180 days, you know, a long time. These are people that have been really, really horribly treated.
I've never seen anything like it actually. I was very surprised to hear the answer.
[Crosstalk]
Thank you, Mr. President. Are there two or three countries that are on your list that you feel are farther along in getting their tariffs lowered?
I think -- well, I think there are many that want to get rid of tariffs right now. European Union, I mean, as badly as they've treated us -- you know, they've brought their car tariffs essentially off. I guess they brought it down to 2.5, and I hear maybe to nothing. But it's not only tariffs, it's non-monetary tariffs.
It's tariffs where they put things on that make it impossible for you to sell a car. It's not a money thing. It's -- they make it so difficult, the standards and the tests. They drop a bowling ball on the top of your car from 20 feet up in the air. And if there's a little dent, they say no, I'm sorry, your car doesn't qualify.
When the same car from Germany or anything would dent likewise, unless you can have an army tank, it's going to dent. So, they come up with rules and regulations that are just designed for one reason, that you can't sell your product in those countries. And we're not going to let that happen. Those are called non-monetary barriers.
They make barriers that are so tough that it's impossible to qualify. So, tariffs are a big part of it, but there's another big part of it and that's barriers. They also do something else. They manipulate their currency, and they drive it down. They want to drive it -- they want to have low currencies. You know, it sounds better to have a high currency, a strong dollar or whatever, but they bring their currency down.
And when it competes with our currency, it's very hard to sell a tractor, it's very hard to sell product because their currency is low and ours is much higher, relatively. And so, it makes it very hard. I speak to a lot of companies that do business -- tractor companies, and they say it's so hard to sell because what they've done is they've lowered the yen, or they've lowered the wan or they've lowered their currency so that it's very hard to compete.
We don't want that either. So, we have a lot of things that we're talking about, but we're going to fix it properly and it's going to be fair to everybody. And in the end, I think we're going to have a world that does a lot better, you know. But they have to respect the United States --
[Crosstalk]
-- and nobody but me would do this. Nobody but me would do this. You know, it would be nice to serve a nice easy term, but we have an opportunity to change the fabric of our country. We have an opportunity to reset the table on trade. We lose billions of dollars. We lose close to $2 trillion a year on trade.
We lose $1 trillion a year to China, a trillion. We lose hundreds of billions of dollars a year on trade to China. We lose hundreds of billions of dollars overall, probably close to $2 trillion. Why would we do that? Number one, why would we do that? And then you have to say is it sustainable? Then you hear about all of the people that say, well deficits, if we have a deficit with the country or if the country has a big surplus with us, like China has a massive surplus that they take and they spend on their military.
Well, we don't want that. I don't want them to take five -- $600 billion a year and spend it on their military, I don't want them spending money on their military. And I shouldn't have to spend money, we shouldn't have to spend it either because hopefully, and I said this to President Xi, hopefully it's money that we're never going to use.
In other words, because we're not going to use those incredible weapons that we have and that they have. We don't want that. So it's going to be very interesting. It's the only chance our country will have to reset the table because no other president would be willing to do what I'm doing or to even go through it. Now, I don't mind going through it because I see a beautiful picture at the end, but we are making tremendous progress with a lot of countries.
And the countries that really took advantage of us are now saying please negotiate. You know why, because they're getting beaten badly because of what's happening. They're getting beaten badly. They're being devalued as countries. But it's the only chance we're going to have to reset the table on trade. And when we do, we're going to come out unbelievably well.
We're going to have a strong country economically again and we're going to have those factories that are empty all over the United States. We've lost 90,000 plants and factories. Think of this, 90,000 -- you wouldn't think it's possible, 90,000 plants and factories since NAFTA. Which was, by the way, the worst trade deal ever developed, ever had by any country, anywhere, NAFTA. And I terminated NAFTA. Everybody said it would be impossible and I terminated, through Congress.
We terminated it. You had to get it through Congress. It was a trap. It was a horrible thing and we got it done, and we went to the USMCA, which was much better. The problem is they cheat. They cheat like crazy. Canada cheats. Mexico cheats. Just one of those things. But we are resetting a table and we're going to have great trade and we're going to have a very strong country.
Our country is going to be at a level that it has maybe never been or maybe -- our country was the strongest, believe it or not, from 1870 to 1913. You know why? It was all tariff based. We had no income tax. Then in 1913, some genius came up with the idea of let's charge the people of our country, not foreign countries that are ripping off our country.
And the country was never, relatively, was never that kind of wealth. We had so much wealth, we didn't know what to do with our money. We had meetings. We had committees. And these committees worked tirelessly to study one subject. We have so much money. What are we going to do with it? Who are we going to give it to? And I hope we're going to be in that position again.
Do you plan to reduce the tariffs that your government put on Israeli goods?
On where?
On Israeli goods, the 70 percent. Do you plan --
Well, we're talking about a whole new trade, maybe not, maybe not. Don't forget, we help Israel a lot. We give Israel $4 billion a year. That's a lot. Congratulations, by the way. That's pretty good. But we give Israel billions of dollars a year, billions.
It's one of the highest of any -- we give a lot of countries money. You wouldn't believe if I said we give Afghanistan a lot of money, because that was a Biden deal, another Biden deal. Not only did he embarrass us with that, but they give them billions of dollars, Afghanistan, right? But no, we take good care of our friends and we don't take care of our enemies.
We're not taking care of our enemies anymore, but we do take care of our friends.
[Inaudible] from the Times of Israel. The IDF is fighting again in the Gaza Strip. I myself might be called up in a month. Do you think that's the way to pressure Hamas to get to a deal? And do you think blocking humanitarian aid is also an effective pressure?
Well, you know how I feel about the Gaza Strip. I think it's an incredible piece of important real estate and I think it's something that we would be involved in, but having a peace force like the United States there controlling and owning the Gaza Strip would be a good thing. Because right now, all it is, is for years and years, all I hear about is killing and Hamas and problems.
And if you take the people, the Palestinians and move them around to different countries and you have plenty of countries that will do that, and you really have a freedom zone. You call it the freedom zone, a free zone, a zone where people aren't going to be killed every day. That's a hell of a place. You know what I call it, a great location that nobody wants to live in, because they really don't. And when they have good living, real living, where Hamas and all of the problems they have, the level of death on the Gaza Strip is just incredible.
And I've said it, I don't understand why Israel ever gave it up. Israel owned it. It wasn't this man's -- I can say it. He wouldn't have given it up. I know him very well. There's no way. They took oceanfront property and they gave it to people for peace. How did that work out? Not good.
Sir, Mr. President, is the immigration plan still on the agenda?
Which immigration?
Gaza. In Gaza.
All it is, is a concept that I had that I think is good and now people are copying it. Bibi, do you want to tell -- people are talking about the Trump plan. Gee, why don't we do that? Would you like to answer that question?
I think what the president talked about is first of all to give people a choice. Gazans were closed in. In every other place including in arenas of battle. I mean, whether it's Ukraine or Syria or any other place, people could leave. Gaza was the only place where they locked them in. We didn't lock them in. They are locked in. And what is wrong with giving people a choice?
Now we've been talking over lunch about some countries, I won't go into them right now, that are saying, if Gazans want to leave, we want to take them in. And I think this is the right thing to do. It's going to take years to rebuild Gaza. In the meantime, people can have an option. The president has a vision.
Countries are responding to that vision. We're working on it. I hope we'll have good news for you.
I will say, people love -- excuse me. People really do love that vision. It's a long-term vision, but so importantly is to have that be a safe field because you're right smack in the middle of the Middle East. You're right along Israel. It should have never ever been given away. It shouldn't have been given away by Israel.
I don't know why they did it. I mean, I do know why, because they were promised peace, but that didn't work out too well because it's one of the most dangerous pieces of land anywhere in the world. Gaza is one of the most dangerous places in the world, so they gave it away for good intention and it didn't work out that way.
And a lot of people like my concept, but there are other concepts that I like too. And there are some concepts I don't like. You know what I don't like, the way it is now, because right now it's a dangerous death trap, Gaza. Yeah.
Thank you, sir. Can you talk a little bit about your meeting, potential meeting with Vladimir Putin? Do you still plan to meet with him? Could that happen in Saudi Arabia? And maybe you could elaborate as well a little bit on not providing tariffs on Russia, sir.
So the reason we're not talking about tariffs with Russia is because we're not doing business, essentially, with Russia because they're in a war. And I'm not happy about what's going on with the bombing because they're bombing like crazy right now. They're bombing. I don't know what's happening there. That's not a good situation.
So we're meeting with Russia. We're meeting with Ukraine and we're getting sort of close, but I'm not happy with all the bombing that's going on in the last week or so. Horrible. It's a horrible thing. It's a horrible thing. Yeah.
Can countries negotiate to get below 10 percent?
In terms of tariffs?
In terms of tarrifs, yes.
Look, we've been ripped off and taken advantage of for 40, 50, 60 years. And the reason we got ripped off and the way they did it was tariffs. They would charge tariffs, massive numbers of dollars. And when you look at China, when I took over, it was at $507 billion they were making. I call it, making a lot of people say, oh, it doesn't mean anything.
Having a surplus means a lot, in my opinion. It's almost like a profit or loss statement. And when I took over, it was $507 billion that China -- this is originally first term, and we were very, very tough on them because they were taking that money and they were building a military with it. Then when Biden came in, he let them get away with murder.
He had no idea. I'll tell you what, that man had no idea what was happening, whether it was the border or China or anything else. He had no idea what was going on, and they went wild. China went wild and the money they make is ridiculous. OK? It's just not going to happen and hopefully we'll get along with China.
If we do, that's great. And if we don't, that's Ok too, but we can't let that continue because that's an abuse -- they abused the poor people that sat in the seat, that poor Biden. He was abused by them. They took advantage of him. And I'm surprised. They have smart people. They were radical left lunatics, but they're smart.
I'm surprised they'd allow that to happen, but we are going to bring great trade, and we're going to be fair to other countries. And I will say this, virtually every country wants to negotiate. If I didn't do what I did over the last couple of weeks, you wouldn't have anybody who wants to negotiate. We would have gone to these countries -- you want to talk, and they were -- well, we don't want to talk.
Now they're coming to us, they're offering things like -- even Bibi, and this is unrelated because it's a different kind of a relationship. But he started off our conversation today that he's cutting all of the tariffs, he's cutting everything, he's going to get down to a free base. He's going to do things that, in all fairness, other countries, if they said that, would have never even thought about doing it. Now they're offering things to us that we would have never even thought of asking them for because they're experiencing a lot of hurt.
And the hurt is that they've taken advantage of us and we finally fought back. Tariffs will make this country very rich. We're rich anyway, but we're rich in a certain way. We have $36 trillion in debt; I want to get rid of it and we can do it quickly with proper deals. So, when countries don't allow us to sell our product, but we allow them to sell their product, when they charge us massive amounts of money for the privilege of going into their country.
Those days are over. Ok. Yeah. Go ahead, sir.
Me?
Yeah, he sounds so surprised.
Thank you, Mr. President. On Iran, two questions please. First, can give us more details about where the meeting on Saturday is going to take place?
I can't tell you that. I can just tell you there's a major meeting going on between us and Iran and that will take place on Saturday and it's at top level.
And second question about this, a lot of people think that those talks are not going to lead anywhere because the Iranians will never give up their nuclear program.
You may be right. I think that's a possibility.
It fails if diplomacy fails, is the United States, under your leadership, ready to take military action to destroy the Iranian nuclear program and remove this threat?
I think if the talks aren't successful with Iran, I think Iran is going to be in great danger. And I hate to say it, great danger because they can't have a nuclear weapon.
So, is that a yes?
You know, it's not a complicated formula. Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon, that's all there is, can't have it. Right now --
[Crosstalk]
-- we have countries that have nuclear power that shouldn't have it, but I'm sure we'll be able to negotiate out of that too as part of this later on down the line. But Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. And if the talks aren't successful, I actually think it will be a very bad day for Iran if that's the case.
Yeah.
Mr. President, on manufacturing --
Yeah, please.
Mr. President, was October 7th, the deathblow of the two-state solution? And would you consider classifying the Palestinian Authority as a terrorist organization for its continued pay-for-slay terror financing payments?
So, October 7th, was a horrible day that some people, they deny it. Now, I can't believe they deny it from the standpoint of they do it because they think it's good politically. But October -- I've seen the tapes. I've seen things that you don't want to see. October 7th, was a horrible day and it will go down as one of the really bad days in the history of the world.
It was a horrible, horrible thing that happened. And they grabbed some of these people -- I'll give you an example. When I was with the 10 hostages a few weeks ago, I said, so how many are there? 59? I said, oh, so 59. So, we can get 59. They sort of knew the territory pretty good and I said, how are they doing?
They said, well, only 24 are living, the rest are dead. And these are young people, largely. Young people don't die. You know, young people have an amazing ability to live. They can live through horrible things. But these are young people and when they said that 24 are living and the rest are dead. And you know, I've had parents come up, Israeli parents largely, we have some Americans.
And we had -- I guess we have one left, Alex, we have the one left. But I've had Israeli parents come up to me at events and say my son is there. I said, well, how's he doing? Well, he's dead. But would you do me the biggest favor ever? Could you bring his body back home? They talked about a young dead boy and a young dead girl like they were living.
And that could have something to do with religion that could have something to do with -- I guess maybe any parent would be. But I was surprised. They said, sir, my son is dead. It is just as important to bring that body back home. I asked that question as if he were alive. So, you have a lot of them dead and we'll be able to bring them back.
But it's a horrible thing that's happened. These are young -- largely young people, some old ones too, frankly. And those people have lived in hell when they came off. The second group that came out, they looked like they just got out of a concentration camp. They looked exactly like the pictures that I see from the 1940s, the concentration camps.
And then they got a little bit better, you know, but that second group, those people came out and I said this is unbelievable. We're going back into a chapter in history that is one of the worst ever. It's really very bad. OK?
[Crosstalk]
Mr. President, you said it could take two years to get American manufacturing fully up to speed in response to these tariffs. What happens in the meantime? Should Americans be prepared for years of disruption?
We have now $7 trillion -- think of this, $7 trillion of commitments from companies wanting to go in from Apple to -- many, many companies.
But that takes time.
Many from Taiwan. What?
It takes time to --
[Crosstalk]
Well, are you asking me a question or are you telling me? Yeah, it takes time. You know, you've got to build a thing called a factory, you have to build your energy. You have to do a lot of things. I'm giving them energy. You know, we're going to let them build their own power plants, they'll be their own.
Essentially, they're going to be in charge of the power plant because our power is not reliable enough. You have a grid that's old and susceptible to a lot of things, including bombing and weather and a lot of other things. And we're going to give them record timing in terms of approvals of electric plants.
Most of them want to build electric plants. We need massive amounts of electricity if we're going to compete with China and others. And interestingly, we're way ahead right now in the AI race with China. But the way we lose that race is if we can't give them electric. But we have more plants being built.
We have everything -- we're doing so great, and we want to keep it that way. And tariffs will be an important part of it. But one of the other things, Lee Zeldin has done a fantastic job, head of environmental protection. And he's doing very rapid approvals for people to get -- for big companies that are going to build a plant that's going to cost billions of dollars.
And we're going to get them their approvals. They have to be environmentally perfect, everything good, but they're going to be in record time, a matter of months versus a matter of many, many years.
But in the meantime --
[Crosstalk]
Go ahead.
Yeah, [Inaudible]. Turkey claims it will stabilize the situation in Syria.
Turkey?
Yeah. Israel doesn't want Turkey to influence in Syria. What do you think? Do you think Turkey's influence in Syria can actually make it a better, more peaceful country or vice versa?
Well, I have a great relationship with a man named Erdogan. Have you heard of him? And I happen to like him, and he likes me, and I know the press will get very angry. He likes Erdogan. But I do and he likes me, and we've never had a problem. And we've gone through a lot and we've never had a problem. We've always got -- as you remember, we got our minister back from Turkey.
You remember that. And this was a big deal at the time, and we got him back. And I told the prime minister, I said just, Bibi, if you have a problem with Turkey, I really think I'm going to be able to work it out. You know, I have a very, very good relationship with Turkey and with their leader and I think we'll be able to work it out.
So, I hope that's not going to be a problem. I don't think it will be a problem. Now with that being said, I believe it was Turkey, and I said that to him. I said it, I said congratulations, you've done what nobody's been able to do in 2,000 years, you've taken over Syria with different names, but same thing.
I said, you've taken it over. He's taken it over through surrogates. He goes no, no, no, no, no, no, it was not me. I said it was you, but that's OK, you don't have to say -- well, it sort of maybe was me, OK. But what he did -- look, he's a tough guy and he's very smart and he did something that nobody was able to do. You've got to hand it to him.
Any problem that you have with Turkey, I think I can solve, I mean as long as you're reasonable. You have to be reasonable; we have to be reasonable. Thank you very much, everybody. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you.",8,thank you very much it s an honor to have a very very special person i ve dealt with him for a long time benjamin netanyahu prime minister of israel and we had lunch together we had meetings together along with his very capable staff and i think we ve come up to some pretty good solutions and conclusions and we ll be working a little bit after this and then i assume you re going back home yes sir this is a quick stop in and out but we appreciate you being here and we are a friend of israel as you know i would say that i m by far the best president that israel has ever even thought of seeing and it s an honor to be so and to be so thought of many friends in israel they are not in an easy area it doesn t go easy but we are helping them and likewise they ve been helping us very much and so we ll see how it all works out but we had great discussions today i think on the obvious subject of iran and also the less obvious of subject with respect to israel and that s trade and i think the prime minister is going to tell you a little bit about trade and what they re doing for the united states so i want to thank you all for being here thank you very much and benjamin thank you very much thank you mr president thank you donald thank you mr president i want to first thank you for inviting me again to the white house you ve been a remarkable friend of the state of israel you stand by us you re standing with us you are a great great champion of our alliance and you actually do the things that you say you do and i think that people respect that enormously i certainly do and the people of israel do and i think the jewish people do as well we just saw your representative in the department of justice fighting anti semitism standing up for israel in international forums i just want you to know from the heart it s deeply deeply appreciated as you said we had the opportunity to talk today about many subjects first if i can mention tariffs it s a subject of some interest today i can tell you that i said to the president a very simple thing we will eliminate the trade deficit with the united states we intend to do it very quickly we think it s the right thing to do and we re going to also eliminate trade barriers a variety of trade barriers that have been put up unnecessarily and i think israel can serve as a model for many countries who ought to do the same i recognize the position of the united states it says you know we re allowing other countries to put tariffs on us but we don t put tariffs on them and you know i m a free trade champion and free trade has to be fair trade and i think that s basically the position that you have put forward mr president we are going to eliminate the tariffs and rapidly i had the opportunity to speak to secretary lutnick yesterday we talked about how we could affect this quickly and i hope to bring a solution very quickly we re not talking about intentions we re not talking about just words we re talking about results and those results are going to come in so that s the first thank you very much that s very nice thank you mr president what about the hostage deal let him let him finish i m finished inaudible we spoke about not only the hostages but about gaza the hostages obviously is a human story of an just unbearable agony i speak to the families i spoke to them yesterday i spoke to another one when i was in hungary before i came here i speak to them every day and they re in agony the hostages are in agony and we want to get them all out steve witkoff president trump s very able representative helped us get a deal that got out we re working now on another deal that we hope will succeed and we re committed to getting all the hostages out but also eliminating the evil tyranny of hamas in gaza and enabling the people of gaza to freely make a choice to go wherever they want i mean they should have that choice and the president put forward a vision a bold vision which we discussed as well including the countries that might be amenable and are amenable to accepting palestinians of their free choice if they choose to go there and i think that s the second thing that we discussed but the hostages came right on top we also discussed the situation in syria we ve had neighborly relations with turkey that have deteriorated and we don t want to see syria being used by anyone including turkey as a base for attack in israel turkey is a country that has a great relationship with the united states the president has a relationship with the leader of turkey we discussed how we can avoid this conflict in a variety of ways and i think we can t have a better interlocutor than the president of the united states for this purpose and of course we also discussed iran look we re both united in the goal that iran does not ever get nuclear weapons if it can be done diplomatically in a full way the way it was done in libya i think that would be a good thing but whatever happens we have to make sure that iran does not have nuclear weapons that s the end of my speech mr president crosstalk we are we re having direct talks with crosstalk wait a minute wait wait wait we re having direct talks with iran and they ve started it ll go on saturday we have a very big meeting and we ll see what can happen and i think everybody agrees that doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious and the obvious is not something that i want to be involved with or frankly that israel wants to be involved with if they can avoid it so we re going to see if we can avoid it but it s getting to be very dangerous territory and hopefully those talks will be successful and i think it would be in iran s best interests if they are successful we hope that s going to happen and we had just a lot of good talks on a lot of things i appreciate very much what you said about the tariffs we ve been ripped off and taken advantage of by many countries over the years and can t do it anymore just can t do it anymore we can t be the stupid people anymore and it s all because of the people that sat in the seat right here not your seat but this seat they allowed things to happen to our country that they shouldn t have allowed to happen on trade and other things many other things i mean look at what s happened with our last president where he allowed millions of people to come into our country with an open border who would want an open border how stupid is that but he allowed millions and millions of people and of the millions and i think it was million people but let s say three of them were serious criminals serious murderers and drug dealers and gang members and people from jails all the jails emptied out right into our country right along the open border on mexico generally the mexico border they came in from canada too by the way a lot but generally speaking on the southern border and what a shame it is that we are now working very hard to get them out get the criminals out get the murderers out the drug dealers the mentally insane get them out they dropped the mentally insane in our country too and this was all done by the biden administration it s a disgrace that we have to work so hard and then we have judges that try and protect these people but they didn t protect us when the people were being let in but to get them out is never easy with these people so i think we re doing a great job the border is the best it s ever been even as strong as it was i had a great solid border i think it might even be tougher right now and stronger so people are coming into our country but they re coming in legally we have a legal process and we have that moving along properly because we need people to come into our country but we want people that can love our country and cherish our country so that s where we are and with that any questions crosstalk the market today and would you be open to a pause in tariffs to allow for negotiations well we re not looking at that we have many many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us and they re going to be fair deals and in certain cases they re going to be paying substantial tariffs they ll be fair deals as you know i spoke this morning with the prime minister of japan and we had a very good conversation they re coming and i said one thing you re going to have to open up your country because we sold no cars like zero cars in japan and they sold millions of cars into our country they don t really take our agriculture a little bit of it just to keep us slightly happy but they don t take what they re supposed to be taking so we have a great relationship with japan we re going to keep it that way but they re coming in to meet and other countries are coming in with china as you know against my statement they put a percent tariff on above what their ridiculous tariffs were already and i said if that tariff isn t removed by tomorrow at we re putting a percent tariff on above the tariffs that we put on so they ve gone for years they ve become a rich country because of people again that were in the white house that allowed this to happen hundreds of billions of dollars a year they d make on us on trade and it shouldn t be that way and i have a great relationship with president xi i hope it s going to stay that way i have great respect for china but they can t do this with just we re going to have one shot at this and no other president is going to do this what i m doing and i ll tell you what it s an honor to do it because we have been just destroyed what they ve done to our system you know we have $ trillion of debt for a reason and the reason is that people are allowed it to get that way so we ll be talking to china we ll be talking to a lot of different countries and i think if we can make a really fair deal and a good deal for the united states not a good deal for other this is america first it s now america first and we didn t put america first we put america last the people that were in the oval office put america last and we re not going to stand for it yeah go ahead go ahead two questions do you expect any of these deals to be made before april th and secondly there have been some mixed messages from your administration you re talking about negotiations and yet others in your administration are saying that these tariffs are actually permanent what is the actual well they can both be true there can be permanent tariffs and there can also be negotiations because there are things that we need beyond tariffs we need open borders we almost had a deal with china where we were going to open up china it was almost done some of you remember it during my first term and it was very disappointing we ended up making a great deal $ billion worth of product was sold $ billion you d like that in israel and i made that deal but it wasn t the deal that i wanted the deal that i wanted was that plus they were going to open up china so that our companies could go into china and compete with other countries and china for a large number of people and at the very end that deal was terminated and we went to a piece of the deal and so there are a lot of things outside of tariffs but tariffs are very important but there are a lot of things like opening up countries that were totally closed china s essentially a closed country in fact it is a closed country and what they do is they charge tariffs so that if you sell cars or if you sell anything nobody s going to buy it because the price is out of control but that s true with a lot of other countries also so we re going to get fair deals and good deals with every country and if we don t we re going to have nothing to do with them they re not going to be allowed to participate in the united states crosstalk hold it hold it hold it hold it relax we have time this gentleman has all day long mr president many of thank you for the go ahead many palestinian americans who voted for you voted for you and not for biden because you ve promised them to end the war in gaza correct i m very honored by that vote too the war is still going on and there s no hostage deal do you have any update on that well i d like to see the war stop and i think the war will stop at some point that won t be in the too distant future right now we have a problem with hostages we re trying to get the hostages out we ve got quite a few of them out but it s a long process it shouldn t be that long we have a big problem that we ve done i think i ll ask pete to maybe talk about it for a second because a lot of people are asking the houthis we ve been very tough and very successful militarily we ve really damaged them badly these were people shooting down ships and other things by the way flying objects like airplanes and we ve put a major hurt on the houthis which nobody s been able to do we ve really hit them hard and they know it and they don t know what to do and it s every night night after night and we ve gotten many of their leaders and their experts their experts on missiles i mean they actually make missiles nobody thought that but they make missiles it s highly sophisticated and they re very tough but they ve been very badly damaged nobody else was able to do that but us pete do you want to discuss that please yes sir it s been a bad three weeks for the houthis and it s about to get worse it s been a devastating campaign whether it s underground facilities weapons manufacturing bunkers troops in the open air defense assets we are not going to relent and it s only to get more unrelenting until the houthis declare they will stop shooting at our ships and we ve been very clear with the iranians as well they should not continue to provide support to the houthis and that message has been made very clear so we have a lot more options and a lot more pressure to apply and we know because we see the reports how devastating this campaign has been in them and we will not relent we have a great military there s no military like our military and despite biden having given a lot but nevertheless a pretty small piece but it was a lot of our military away in afghanistan and one of the dumbest situations i think and maybe the most embarrassing situation we ve ever been involved in that short period of time in afghanistan what a disgrace that was but left a lot of our military behind you see them in their annual parades where they re parading trucks that are armor plated and different things that they can but it s many billions of dollars we left behind but despite that we have a tremendous military that was a very small portion because we rebuilt the military during my first term and we have great things happening with our military we also essentially approved a budget which is in the facility you ll like to hear this of $ trillion $ trillion and nobody s seen anything like it we have to build our military and we re very cost conscious but the military is something that we have to build and we have to be strong because you got a lot of bad forces out there now so we re going to be approving a budget and i m proud to say actually the biggest one we ve ever done for the military we re cutting other things that were under doge but under a lot of other when you look at a woman getting $ billion for environmental and it had nothing to do with environmental and they had $ in the bank and they give her $ billion many many of those cases all that stuff is going to be cut out but we are getting a very very powerful military we have things under order now the likes of which we ve never had before we ve never had the kind of aircraft the kind of missiles anything that we have ordered and it s in many ways too bad that we have to do it because hopefully we re not going to have to use it but the military is very very powerful and it s going to remain that way go ahead please please yes inaudible thank you mr president i wanted to ask you about iran because this is the first time we hear that the us is having a direct contact with them is it possible to get some more information at what level is the us high level very high level yeah we re dealing with the iranians we have a very big meeting on saturday and we re dealing with them directly a lot of people say oh maybe you re going through surrogates or you re not dealing directly you re dealing through other countries no we re dealing with them directly and maybe a deal is going to be made that would be great it would be really great for iran i can tell you that but hopefully we re not going to have to get into that we are meeting very importantly on saturday at almost the highest level and we ll see how it works out please how do you assure mr president that these tariffs don t drive us trading partners into the hands of the chinese i m not worried about it i m not worried about it if they want to be in the hands of the us they don t want to be in the hands of the chinese and the chinese have turned out to be really not very good at that people that are with us they re with us but we cannot be taken advantage of any longer i used to watch these deals for years i ve been talking about it for years i ve been talking about it for years how our country is being ripped off i mean years ago it was japan then it was something else then it was another group then it was china china s doing the best job of it frankly and it s just not going to happen not going to happen mr president inaudible has said that they have offered zero for zero tariffs on cars and industrial goods is that not enough well the eu no it s not the eu has been very tough over the years i always say it was formed to really do damage to the united states in trade that s the reason it was formed it was formed with all of the countries from europe i guess most of them not all of them but most of them and they formed together to create a little bit of a monopoly situation to create a unified force against the united states for trade so they have nato which is largely the same countries and they took advantage of us dollar wise and militarily until i got there i was able to get $ billion from nato where they paid nato because most of these nations weren t even paying we were paying for nato so we re paying them to guard them militarily and they re screwing us on trade so that s not a good combination so now it s really turned around it s the opposite and the european union s been very bad to us they don t take our cars like japan in that sense they don t take our agricultural product they don t take anything practically and yet they send millions of cars in a year mercedes benz volkswagen bmws they re sending millions and millions of cars into the us but we don t have a car that s been sold to the european union or other places but let s go for the european union and it s not going to be that way it s got to be fair and reciprocal it s got to be fair it s not fair we have a deficit with the european union of $ billion and it s going to disappear fast and one of the reasons and one of the ways that that can disappear easily and quickly is they re going to have to buy our energy from us because they need it they re going to have to buy it from us they can buy it we can knock off $ billion in one week they have to buy and commit to buy a like amount of energy and we have that you know we have more energy than any country in the world i don t know if you know that he knows everything but the one thing he may not know we have more energy than any country in the world we have more of every kind of energy every form of energy from oil and gas to coal and people talk about i call it beautiful clean coal as you know germany is opening up a coal plant a week they tried the windmills and it didn t work they tried all the other solutions and they were ready to go out of business now they re doing a coal plant a week china is now up to two coal plants they re opening two major coal plants every single week in china all over china and then we re not allowed to use coal well we have clean beautiful coal more than anybody else we have oil and gas more than anybody else we have the most energy of any country in the world including saudi arabia including everybody by a lot and i took it to number one we were number three and i took it to number one during my administration and the reason that we were hurt so badly and the reason that we went into such incredible inflation during biden is energy it was also their bad spending but energy because they played around with this incredible thing that we had built this administration had built and the energy costs went through the roof and when that went up everything else followed now if you look at what s happening you re going to see this today i said we re going to try and get groceries down right an old fashioned term but a beautiful term eggs so when i got in the press went absolutely crazy the first week they said eggs have quadrupled in price i said i just got here tell me about it and brooke rollins and our team did a great job and eggs are down now percent and they re all over the place and this was a problem that somebody else would have taken a long time to cure we have energy is down we have interest rates are down we have groceries meaning food is down we have everything is down at levels that nobody ever thought possible wnergy looks like it s going to be in the $ a gallon range and maybe below that for a car so for gasoline so we re really doing amazing i mean we re cutting prices because prices got so high people couldn t live i mean the prices for groceries the prices for standard standard groceries standard things were going through the roof they couldn t live and now those prices are coming down so call them groceries but that s down energy is down and interest rates are down everything s down and the interest rates the beauty there is when we refinance debt you know debt has become such a big factor in this country we re going to get we re going to start paying debt off with tariffs and other things but it s such a big factor because the interest rates so high well now that s coming way down so our budget s going to look a lot better because interest costs are way down and i guess i ve done that crosstalk many israelis are watching you now on live show good i hope they like me crosstalk to getting the hostages out from the horrific captivity we are trying very hard to get the hostages out we re looking at another ceasefire we ll see what happens but we want to get the hostages out the israeli people want the hostages out more than anything they want the hostages out this man is working very hard with us to do that i mean i don t know i hope he s being appreciated because he s been a great leader he s working very very hard on the hostages and many other things and there are plenty of things you have to work on it s a tough place in the world isn t it i have a good partner yeah you do have a good partner and so do we we re working very hard on the hostages crosstalk if you re going to negotiate a new deal with iran can you elaborate how it s going to be more effective than the jcpoa well i can t really say that but i think it will be different and maybe a lot stronger but they were so happy when we made that first deal because we did get a lot out you know i had people right in this office this beautiful oval office they came in people hostages you know that and i said to them so how was it and the stories they told me i mean as an example i said to them was there any sign of love you were there people it s only but it s pretty representative did the hamas show any signs of like help or liking you did they wink at you did they give you a piece of bread extra did they give you a meal on the side like you know you think of doing like what happened in germany what happened elsewhere people would try and help people that were in unbelievable distress they said no i said all of them i said did they ever wink at you like you ll be ok you re going to be ok no they didn t do that they d slap us the hatred is unbelievable and the lives you know they lived in a pipe not really a tunnel it was a pipe and they always thought they were suffocating they were going to suffocate and then they d open up the pipe and it was like feet high this isn t you know we hear tunnel is bad but pipes are worse and the stories i heard were incredible but i just said was there any sign of potential love or affection and there were none whatsoever it was amazing to me there was nothing like here take this it s a little extra meal or something they lived like hell i don t know they seem to be they were amazing to me because they seemed to be pretty normal they weren t scarred but i guarantee underneath they have to be scarred and one was there for days another was there for about days you know a long time these are people that have been really really horribly treated i ve never seen anything like it actually i was very surprised to hear the answer crosstalk thank you mr president are there two or three countries that are on your list that you feel are farther along in getting their tariffs lowered i think well i think there are many that want to get rid of tariffs right now european union i mean as badly as they ve treated us you know they ve brought their car tariffs essentially off i guess they brought it down to and i hear maybe to nothing but it s not only tariffs it s non monetary tariffs it s tariffs where they put things on that make it impossible for you to sell a car it s not a money thing it s they make it so difficult the standards and the tests they drop a bowling ball on the top of your car from feet up in the air and if there s a little dent they say no i m sorry your car doesn t qualify when the same car from germany or anything would dent likewise unless you can have an army tank it s going to dent so they come up with rules and regulations that are just designed for one reason that you can t sell your product in those countries and we re not going to let that happen those are called non monetary barriers they make barriers that are so tough that it s impossible to qualify so tariffs are a big part of it but there s another big part of it and that s barriers they also do something else they manipulate their currency and they drive it down they want to drive it they want to have low currencies you know it sounds better to have a high currency a strong dollar or whatever but they bring their currency down and when it competes with our currency it s very hard to sell a tractor it s very hard to sell product because their currency is low and ours is much higher relatively and so it makes it very hard i speak to a lot of companies that do business tractor companies and they say it s so hard to sell because what they ve done is they ve lowered the yen or they ve lowered the wan or they ve lowered their currency so that it s very hard to compete we don t want that either so we have a lot of things that we re talking about but we re going to fix it properly and it s going to be fair to everybody and in the end i think we re going to have a world that does a lot better you know but they have to respect the united states crosstalk and nobody but me would do this nobody but me would do this you know it would be nice to serve a nice easy term but we have an opportunity to change the fabric of our country we have an opportunity to reset the table on trade we lose billions of dollars we lose close to $ trillion a year on trade we lose $ trillion a year to china a trillion we lose hundreds of billions of dollars a year on trade to china we lose hundreds of billions of dollars overall probably close to $ trillion why would we do that number one why would we do that and then you have to say is it sustainable then you hear about all of the people that say well deficits if we have a deficit with the country or if the country has a big surplus with us like china has a massive surplus that they take and they spend on their military well we don t want that i don t want them to take five $ billion a year and spend it on their military i don t want them spending money on their military and i shouldn t have to spend money we shouldn t have to spend it either because hopefully and i said this to president xi hopefully it s money that we re never going to use in other words because we re not going to use those incredible weapons that we have and that they have we don t want that so it s going to be very interesting it s the only chance our country will have to reset the table because no other president would be willing to do what i m doing or to even go through it now i don t mind going through it because i see a beautiful picture at the end but we are making tremendous progress with a lot of countries and the countries that really took advantage of us are now saying please negotiate you know why because they re getting beaten badly because of what s happening they re getting beaten badly they re being devalued as countries but it s the only chance we re going to have to reset the table on trade and when we do we re going to come out unbelievably well we re going to have a strong country economically again and we re going to have those factories that are empty all over the united states we ve lost plants and factories think of this you wouldn t think it s possible plants and factories since nafta which was by the way the worst trade deal ever developed ever had by any country anywhere nafta and i terminated nafta everybody said it would be impossible and i terminated through congress we terminated it you had to get it through congress it was a trap it was a horrible thing and we got it done and we went to the usmca which was much better the problem is they cheat they cheat like crazy canada cheats mexico cheats just one of those things but we are resetting a table and we re going to have great trade and we re going to have a very strong country our country is going to be at a level that it has maybe never been or maybe our country was the strongest believe it or not from to you know why it was all tariff based we had no income tax then in some genius came up with the idea of let s charge the people of our country not foreign countries that are ripping off our country and the country was never relatively was never that kind of wealth we had so much wealth we didn t know what to do with our money we had meetings we had committees and these committees worked tirelessly to study one subject we have so much money what are we going to do with it who are we going to give it to and i hope we re going to be in that position again do you plan to reduce the tariffs that your government put on israeli goods on where on israeli goods the percent do you plan well we re talking about a whole new trade maybe not maybe not don t forget we help israel a lot we give israel $ billion a year that s a lot congratulations by the way that s pretty good but we give israel billions of dollars a year billions it s one of the highest of any we give a lot of countries money you wouldn t believe if i said we give afghanistan a lot of money because that was a biden deal another biden deal not only did he embarrass us with that but they give them billions of dollars afghanistan right but no we take good care of our friends and we don t take care of our enemies we re not taking care of our enemies anymore but we do take care of our friends inaudible from the times of israel the idf is fighting again in the gaza strip i myself might be called up in a month do you think that s the way to pressure hamas to get to a deal and do you think blocking humanitarian aid is also an effective pressure well you know how i feel about the gaza strip i think it s an incredible piece of important real estate and i think it s something that we would be involved in but having a peace force like the united states there controlling and owning the gaza strip would be a good thing because right now all it is is for years and years all i hear about is killing and hamas and problems and if you take the people the palestinians and move them around to different countries and you have plenty of countries that will do that and you really have a freedom zone you call it the freedom zone a free zone a zone where people aren t going to be killed every day that s a hell of a place you know what i call it a great location that nobody wants to live in because they really don t and when they have good living real living where hamas and all of the problems they have the level of death on the gaza strip is just incredible and i ve said it i don t understand why israel ever gave it up israel owned it it wasn t this man s i can say it he wouldn t have given it up i know him very well there s no way they took oceanfront property and they gave it to people for peace how did that work out not good sir mr president is the immigration plan still on the agenda which immigration gaza in gaza all it is is a concept that i had that i think is good and now people are copying it bibi do you want to tell people are talking about the trump plan gee why don t we do that would you like to answer that question i think what the president talked about is first of all to give people a choice gazans were closed in in every other place including in arenas of battle i mean whether it s ukraine or syria or any other place people could leave gaza was the only place where they locked them in we didn t lock them in they are locked in and what is wrong with giving people a choice now we ve been talking over lunch about some countries i won t go into them right now that are saying if gazans want to leave we want to take them in and i think this is the right thing to do it s going to take years to rebuild gaza in the meantime people can have an option the president has a vision countries are responding to that vision we re working on it i hope we ll have good news for you i will say people love excuse me people really do love that vision it s a long term vision but so importantly is to have that be a safe field because you re right smack in the middle of the middle east you re right along israel it should have never ever been given away it shouldn t have been given away by israel i don t know why they did it i mean i do know why because they were promised peace but that didn t work out too well because it s one of the most dangerous pieces of land anywhere in the world gaza is one of the most dangerous places in the world so they gave it away for good intention and it didn t work out that way and a lot of people like my concept but there are other concepts that i like too and there are some concepts i don t like you know what i don t like the way it is now because right now it s a dangerous death trap gaza yeah thank you sir can you talk a little bit about your meeting potential meeting with vladimir putin do you still plan to meet with him could that happen in saudi arabia and maybe you could elaborate as well a little bit on not providing tariffs on russia sir so the reason we re not talking about tariffs with russia is because we re not doing business essentially with russia because they re in a war and i m not happy about what s going on with the bombing because they re bombing like crazy right now they re bombing i don t know what s happening there that s not a good situation so we re meeting with russia we re meeting with ukraine and we re getting sort of close but i m not happy with all the bombing that s going on in the last week or so horrible it s a horrible thing it s a horrible thing yeah can countries negotiate to get below percent in terms of tariffs in terms of tarrifs yes look we ve been ripped off and taken advantage of for years and the reason we got ripped off and the way they did it was tariffs they would charge tariffs massive numbers of dollars and when you look at china when i took over it was at $ billion they were making i call it making a lot of people say oh it doesn t mean anything having a surplus means a lot in my opinion it s almost like a profit or loss statement and when i took over it was $ billion that china this is originally first term and we were very very tough on them because they were taking that money and they were building a military with it then when biden came in he let them get away with murder he had no idea i ll tell you what that man had no idea what was happening whether it was the border or china or anything else he had no idea what was going on and they went wild china went wild and the money they make is ridiculous ok it s just not going to happen and hopefully we ll get along with china if we do that s great and if we don t that s ok too but we can t let that continue because that s an abuse they abused the poor people that sat in the seat that poor biden he was abused by them they took advantage of him and i m surprised they have smart people they were radical left lunatics but they re smart i m surprised they d allow that to happen but we are going to bring great trade and we re going to be fair to other countries and i will say this virtually every country wants to negotiate if i didn t do what i did over the last couple of weeks you wouldn t have anybody who wants to negotiate we would have gone to these countries you want to talk and they were well we don t want to talk now they re coming to us they re offering things like even bibi and this is unrelated because it s a different kind of a relationship but he started off our conversation today that he s cutting all of the tariffs he s cutting everything he s going to get down to a free base he s going to do things that in all fairness other countries if they said that would have never even thought about doing it now they re offering things to us that we would have never even thought of asking them for because they re experiencing a lot of hurt and the hurt is that they ve taken advantage of us and we finally fought back tariffs will make this country very rich we re rich anyway but we re rich in a certain way we have $ trillion in debt i want to get rid of it and we can do it quickly with proper deals so when countries don t allow us to sell our product but we allow them to sell their product when they charge us massive amounts of money for the privilege of going into their country those days are over ok yeah go ahead sir me yeah he sounds so surprised thank you mr president on iran two questions please first can give us more details about where the meeting on saturday is going to take place i can t tell you that i can just tell you there s a major meeting going on between us and iran and that will take place on saturday and it s at top level and second question about this a lot of people think that those talks are not going to lead anywhere because the iranians will never give up their nuclear program you may be right i think that s a possibility it fails if diplomacy fails is the united states under your leadership ready to take military action to destroy the iranian nuclear program and remove this threat i think if the talks aren t successful with iran i think iran is going to be in great danger and i hate to say it great danger because they can t have a nuclear weapon so is that a yes you know it s not a complicated formula iran cannot have a nuclear weapon that s all there is can t have it right now crosstalk we have countries that have nuclear power that shouldn t have it but i m sure we ll be able to negotiate out of that too as part of this later on down the line but iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and if the talks aren t successful i actually think it will be a very bad day for iran if that s the case yeah mr president on manufacturing yeah please mr president was october th the deathblow of the two state solution and would you consider classifying the palestinian authority as a terrorist organization for its continued pay for slay terror financing payments so october th was a horrible day that some people they deny it now i can t believe they deny it from the standpoint of they do it because they think it s good politically but october i ve seen the tapes i ve seen things that you don t want to see october th was a horrible day and it will go down as one of the really bad days in the history of the world it was a horrible horrible thing that happened and they grabbed some of these people i ll give you an example when i was with the hostages a few weeks ago i said so how many are there i said oh so so we can get they sort of knew the territory pretty good and i said how are they doing they said well only are living the rest are dead and these are young people largely young people don t die you know young people have an amazing ability to live they can live through horrible things but these are young people and when they said that are living and the rest are dead and you know i ve had parents come up israeli parents largely we have some americans and we had i guess we have one left alex we have the one left but i ve had israeli parents come up to me at events and say my son is there i said well how s he doing well he s dead but would you do me the biggest favor ever could you bring his body back home they talked about a young dead boy and a young dead girl like they were living and that could have something to do with religion that could have something to do with i guess maybe any parent would be but i was surprised they said sir my son is dead it is just as important to bring that body back home i asked that question as if he were alive so you have a lot of them dead and we ll be able to bring them back but it s a horrible thing that s happened these are young largely young people some old ones too frankly and those people have lived in hell when they came off the second group that came out they looked like they just got out of a concentration camp they looked exactly like the pictures that i see from the s the concentration camps and then they got a little bit better you know but that second group those people came out and i said this is unbelievable we re going back into a chapter in history that is one of the worst ever it s really very bad ok crosstalk mr president you said it could take two years to get american manufacturing fully up to speed in response to these tariffs what happens in the meantime should americans be prepared for years of disruption we have now $ trillion think of this $ trillion of commitments from companies wanting to go in from apple to many many companies but that takes time many from taiwan what it takes time to crosstalk well are you asking me a question or are you telling me yeah it takes time you know you ve got to build a thing called a factory you have to build your energy you have to do a lot of things i m giving them energy you know we re going to let them build their own power plants they ll be their own essentially they re going to be in charge of the power plant because our power is not reliable enough you have a grid that s old and susceptible to a lot of things including bombing and weather and a lot of other things and we re going to give them record timing in terms of approvals of electric plants most of them want to build electric plants we need massive amounts of electricity if we re going to compete with china and others and interestingly we re way ahead right now in the ai race with china but the way we lose that race is if we can t give them electric but we have more plants being built we have everything we re doing so great and we want to keep it that way and tariffs will be an important part of it but one of the other things lee zeldin has done a fantastic job head of environmental protection and he s doing very rapid approvals for people to get for big companies that are going to build a plant that s going to cost billions of dollars and we re going to get them their approvals they have to be environmentally perfect everything good but they re going to be in record time a matter of months versus a matter of many many years but in the meantime crosstalk go ahead yeah inaudible turkey claims it will stabilize the situation in syria turkey yeah israel doesn t want turkey to influence in syria what do you think do you think turkey s influence in syria can actually make it a better more peaceful country or vice versa well i have a great relationship with a man named erdogan have you heard of him and i happen to like him and he likes me and i know the press will get very angry he likes erdogan but i do and he likes me and we ve never had a problem and we ve gone through a lot and we ve never had a problem we ve always got as you remember we got our minister back from turkey you remember that and this was a big deal at the time and we got him back and i told the prime minister i said just bibi if you have a problem with turkey i really think i m going to be able to work it out you know i have a very very good relationship with turkey and with their leader and i think we ll be able to work it out so i hope that s not going to be a problem i don t think it will be a problem now with that being said i believe it was turkey and i said that to him i said it i said congratulations you ve done what nobody s been able to do in years you ve taken over syria with different names but same thing i said you ve taken it over he s taken it over through surrogates he goes no no no no no no it was not me i said it was you but that s ok you don t have to say well it sort of maybe was me ok but what he did look he s a tough guy and he s very smart and he did something that nobody was able to do you ve got to hand it to him any problem that you have with turkey i think i can solve i mean as long as you re reasonable you have to be reasonable we have to be reasonable thank you very much everybody appreciate it thank you thank you
/Users/samantha/Desktop/speech text data/rollcall (4).csv,"Hello, everybody.
How's your [Inaudible]
Are there any questions?
How was the golf tournament?
Uh, very good because I won. [Laughter]
It's good to win. You heard I won, right? Did you hear I won? Just to, uh, back it up. You were there. I won. And I like --
What's your handicap these days?
Very low, have a very low handicap. Okay, let's go.
Sir, uh, Chinese foreign --
Back up a little bit.
Sure. Chinese Foreign Ministry said, uh, that the market is spoken when asked about the tariffs. What do you make of that?
The market has spoken? When they look at the fact that we have a billion dollar trade deficit, when you look at, at the trade deficit that we have with certain countries, way over a billion per country, but with China it's a trillion dollars, and we have to solve our trade deficit. We try, we have a trillion dollar trade deficit with China.
Hundreds of billions of dollars a year we lose with China. And unless we solve that problem, I'm not gonna make a deal. Now I'm willing to deal with China, but they have to solve their surplus. We have a tremendous, uh, deficit problem with China. They have a surplus of at, of least a trillion dollars a year.
I think it's like a trillion [Note: Trump either said ""yuan"" or ""one""] , and I want that solved. And no other president has taken it on. I had to take it on the last time, and then we had a rigged election. No other president has taken it on. And so China is, you know, they say the market has spoken. The market -- China is right now taking a big hit because everyone knows we're right.
We, they have to pay tariffs because, otherwise, we have a surplus, that they have a surplus with us that is not sustainable.
Mr. President --
And we're talking about a trillion dollars, you know that, right? We're not gonna lose a trillion dollars for the privilege of buying pencils from China.
On the idea of crashing the market on [Inaudible], there's been some speculation, partly because of the video that was posted on Truth Social, that there was some sort of deliberate effort on your part to have the market sell off. Can you just talk about that one?
No, that's not so. But I do wanna solve the deficit problem that we have with China, with the European Union and other nations. And they're gonna have to do that. And if they wanna talk about that, I'm open to talking. But otherwise, why would I wanna to talk? And as you know, because of the tariffs, we have $7 trillion already committed to be invested in the United States, building auto plants, building, uh, chip companies, and all sorts of companies are coming into our country at levels that we've never seen before.
Biden had nothing coming in. It was, this was a dead company with -- this was a dead country with Biden. He didn't know what he was doing, and that's now been proven, at least.
You talked to a lot of leaders this weekend. Can you tell us, sir, were there any deals made?
I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world. They're dying to make a deal. But I said, we're not gonna have deficits with your country. We're not gonna do that. Because to me, a deficit is a loss. We're gonna have surpluses who are at worst gonna be breaking even, but China would be the worst, uh, in the group, because the deficit is so big and when -- it's not sustainable, and you know, I was elected on this, this was one of the biggest reasons I got elected.
It's exactly because of this that we're gonna put tariffs and we've already put 'em on. It's not a question of we will, we're gonna put 'em on. And those tariffs next year will make us $1 trillion. In addition to the $1 trillion, thousands of companies are gonna relocate back into the United States. In North Carolina, already furniture people are starting to move back in. In, uh, Detroit and Michigan, which I won because of what I said, what I'm telling you, uh, car companies are starting to open up in Indiana, a big one is under construction, as an example, Honda, but they're moving in like nobody's ever seen this before.
So, it's unsustainable for us to allow China to have surpluses of $1 trillion. We will be taking in over $1 trillion over the next short period of time with the tariffs that I've already instituted. They're already in place. Now, what's going to happen with the market? I can't tell you, but I can tell you our country has gotten a lot stronger, and eventually it'll be a country like no other.
It'll be the most dominant country economically in the world.
Mr. President --
Which is what it should be.
Is there Trump put though? Is there a mark -- is there pain in the market at some point you're unwilling to tolerate this idea of a Trump put. Is there a threshold?
I think your question is so stupid, but I mean, I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something. And we have such a horrible -- we have been treated so badly by other countries, because we had stupid leadership that allowed this to happen. They took our businesses, they took our money, they took our jobs, they moved it to Mexico, they moved it to Canada.
They moved a lot of it to China. And it's not sustainable. We're not going to do it. Now, we have hundreds of billions of dollars is pouring into our country on a monthly basis. It's pouring in. It's already started because I put tariffs on and eventually it's going to straighten out and our country will be solid and strong again.
Elon Musk has said he hopes for zero tariffs between the US and Europe. Is that a place you'd like to also get to?
Well, the problem is that Europe has made a fortune with us. You know, Europe also has had a tremendous, uh, surplus with the United States. Europe has treated us, it's a little smaller, but it -- they've treated us very, very badly. China has, but Europe has also. Europe has been very, very bad to us. Europe has, uh, taken our leaders for a ride.
They don't take our cars. They don't take our food products. They don't take anything. And we take their cars, Mercedes, Volkswagen, BMW. You know, we take their millions of cars. They take no cars. They don't take our farm product. They don't take anything. Europe's treated us very badly. We put a big tariff on Europe.
Uh, they are coming to the table. They want to talk, but there's no talk unless they pay us a lot of money on a yearly basis, uh, number one for present, but also for past, because they've taken a lot of our wealth away and we're not gonna allow it to happen.
Sir, have you talked to any tech leaders over the weekend about the tariffs?
Yeah, I talked to the biggest in the world. I talked to the biggest of them all. Uh, many of them, but I've talked to, uh, I would say four or five that are considered the biggest. They don't -- you know what they said? ""We don't blame you.
Who did you talk to?
Uh, I don't want say. I -- I'll put it out. I may give it to you.
[Inaudible] NVIDIA CEO?
I have to find out if they mind. You know, I don't know if that was a confidential goal or not. But we had five or six. Uh, I've spoken to many countries. They all wanna do it. Just so you understand the power of what I'm doing, every country is calling and being very solicitous of us. Very, very nice. They're being very nice and -- and we have to be able to justify.
We -- this is not sustainable. The United States can't lose $1.9 trillion for trade. We can't do that and also spend a lot of money on NATO in order to protect European nations. We cover them with military, then we lose money on trade. Uh, it's the -- the whole thing is crazy. And I got elected on that basis.
We explained it. You know, the American people understand it a lot better than the media, but the media understands it, and much of the media writes correctly about it, I must say.
Sir.
Okay.
Sir. When do you -- when are the next set of talks with Russia and who will participate? And where are we in terms of making progress in terms of peace?
We're talking to Russia. We'd like him to stop. I don't like the bombing. The bombing goes on and on and every week people and thousands of young people are being killed. And, uh, it's a horrible thing that should have never started, would've never started if I were President, 100%.
On the tariffs, is it a negotiation now?
Who are you with?
Bloomberg, sir. Is it a negotiation or rules of the road?
Go ahead. Another question, please.
Sir, about -- about TikTok.
She asks too many questions.
Sir, about TikTok. There was a report that there was bout to be a deal, but China changed its mind because of the tariffs.
I'd say it was largely true. The report is that we had a deal pretty much with TikTok, not a deal, but pretty close, and then China changed the deal because of tariffs. Uh, if I gave a little cut in tariffs, they'd approve that deal at 15 minutes, which shows you the power of tariffs, right?
Mr. President, former New Hampshire governor Chris Sununu is saying that he'll win the open Senate seat in New Hampshire and that he has no doubt you'll support him if he runs. Is that true?
True. I told him. He came to my office, came to the Oval Office, and met with Chris Sununu, and I support him fully. I hope he runs. He's been very, uh, nice to me over the last year or so. But, uh, no, I hope he runs. I think he'll win that seat.
Sir. When -- when we get into -- to late summer, early fall, and people are doing their back-to-school shopping, do you think they'll have inflation to worry about at that point?
I think there's not gonna be -- I don't think inflation is gonna be a big deal because, if you look at me, I took in hundreds of billions of dollars. This is not new to me. I took in, during my four year, hundreds of billions of dollars from China. And we also took in a lot of money from other countries, but in particular China because it was just getting started.
And there was -- we had no inflation. Who had inflation was by Biden. Biden had the worst inflation in the history of our country. I had no inflation. We had a perfect country. We had no wars. I ended them all. I defeated ISIS. Everything was good. And then when this numbskull got in, as they really call themselves now, numbskulls, but, uh, when he got in, bad things happened to our country, including our -- our open border, that now we're doing very well with.
You know, we -- uh, we have the best numbers on the border that we've ever had.
Speaking of the border, have you talked to Attorney General Pam Bondi recently about the cases going on with the deportations?
Yeah, sure. It's really sad when you think that Biden allowed millions of people to come in and if they find one, now, I will tell you the one, somebody said he's a member of MS-13, not Tren de Aragua. He's a member of MS-13, and therefore he should immediately be brought back. Well, MS-13 is just as bad as Tren de Aragua, so they say, ""Oh, we've made a mistake."" Because he's not with them, he's with MS-13. Bring him back, bring him back.
MS-13's a very bad group.
Sir, how co --
Maybe as bad actually.
How concerned are you about the measles outbreak, there was another fatality today, and what else would you like to see in terms of the response?
Well, I think they, uh, they're doing reports on it. It's so far a fairly small number of people relative to what we're talking about. Something that people have known about for many, many years. I mean, measles has been, you know, this is not something new, and, uh, we'll see what happens, but certainly, uh, if, if something, if it progresses, we'll have to take action.
Very strong, action.
El Salvador's president said on exit, he'd been invited to the White House on April 14 for a working visit to discuss Tren de Aragua and MS-13, and other ways we can support each other, the US and El Salvador. I was curious if you could expand more on what some of these other ideas you have for El Salvador.
Well, I think, yeah, I think, you know, you're in the way of that camera, by the way. Am I, you should at least say that, the camera operator should probably say that he, she's shooting the back of your head. You know, I don't know why she doesn't say it, I have to say it instead. I have great respect for him, I know him.
Uh, I've known him for a long time, he's young leader and he's very tough on crime, very, very tough on crime. And in their system, their prison system, they spend a tiny fraction of the money that this country spends, so, uh, but he is coming in, I don't know when, but he is coming in sometime over the next couple of weeks.
What are you and Prime Minister Netanyahu going to speak about tomorrow?
Uh, we're going to talk about trade and we're gonna talk about the obvious subject. You know, what the obvious subject is.
Do you have any news for us on the obvious subject?
I'm trying, trying to do trade just to keep it down. No, look --
Will there --
There's a, there's a lot of things going on with the Middle East right now that have to be silenced. You know, uh, we had no problem with the Middle East, everything was done, we had, uh, no problem with Iran, we had no problem with anybody. And then you had October 7th, and that was all because Iran, as you know, was not giving money to anybody because they had no money, now they have a lot of money.
So we'll see what happens.
To go back to El Salvador, the president there said he would be willing to take American citizens in the federal prison population, is that one of the ideas you're gonna be discussing?
Well, I love that. If we could take some of our 20-time wise guys that push people into subways, and that hit people over the back of the head, and that purposely run people over in cars. Uh, if he would take them, I'd be honored to give 'em, I don't know what the law says on that, but I can't imagine the law would say anything different.
If they can house these horrible criminals for a lot less money than it costs us, I'm all for it, but I'd only do according to the law. But I have suggested that, you know, why should it stop just at people that cross the border illegally? We have some horrible criminals, American-grown and born, and if we have somebody that bops an old woman over the head, and we have somebody that is in jail 20 times and goes back and shoots people all over the place and then has a bad judge or a bad prosecutor that do nothing about them, all they worry about is politics and don't worry about that, I think if we could get El Salvador or somebody to take them, I'd be very happy with it, but I have to see what the law says.
Okay. What else?
Mr. President, did you say, did you agree to lowering tariffs for any of the countries that you spoke to today?
Oh, no. What you understand, Jennifer, you have to understand this. We have massive surplus countries that we're dealing with, we have massive deficits. We've got to straighten that out because you can't continue to be that way. It's been that way for years now, and it can't go on any longer. And we're the piggy bank, we have all the advantages.
Forget markets for a second, we have all the advantages. We're going to straighten that out, we're gonna become a wealthy nation again, wealthy like never before, and we're not gonna let other nations that have been ripping us off, whether it's China or the European Union, with all of the European nations that have just made, it's been like a feast.
Look, the European Union was formed for one reason. You know what that was? To rip off the United States. So put that in your bonnet. Uh, I hope you had a good flight. Have a good time.
Thank you for your time, Mr. President.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
We'll see you tomorrow.",9,hello everybody how s your inaudible are there any questions how was the golf tournament uh very good because i won laughter it s good to win you heard i won right did you hear i won just to uh back it up you were there i won and i like what s your handicap these days very low have a very low handicap okay let s go sir uh chinese foreign back up a little bit sure chinese foreign ministry said uh that the market is spoken when asked about the tariffs what do you make of that the market has spoken when they look at the fact that we have a billion dollar trade deficit when you look at at the trade deficit that we have with certain countries way over a billion per country but with china it s a trillion dollars and we have to solve our trade deficit we try we have a trillion dollar trade deficit with china hundreds of billions of dollars a year we lose with china and unless we solve that problem i m not gonna make a deal now i m willing to deal with china but they have to solve their surplus we have a tremendous uh deficit problem with china they have a surplus of at of least a trillion dollars a year i think it s like a trillion note trump either said yuan or one and i want that solved and no other president has taken it on i had to take it on the last time and then we had a rigged election no other president has taken it on and so china is you know they say the market has spoken the market china is right now taking a big hit because everyone knows we re right we they have to pay tariffs because otherwise we have a surplus that they have a surplus with us that is not sustainable mr president and we re talking about a trillion dollars you know that right we re not gonna lose a trillion dollars for the privilege of buying pencils from china on the idea of crashing the market on inaudible there s been some speculation partly because of the video that was posted on truth social that there was some sort of deliberate effort on your part to have the market sell off can you just talk about that one no that s not so but i do wanna solve the deficit problem that we have with china with the european union and other nations and they re gonna have to do that and if they wanna talk about that i m open to talking but otherwise why would i wanna to talk and as you know because of the tariffs we have $ trillion already committed to be invested in the united states building auto plants building uh chip companies and all sorts of companies are coming into our country at levels that we ve never seen before biden had nothing coming in it was this was a dead company with this was a dead country with biden he didn t know what he was doing and that s now been proven at least you talked to a lot of leaders this weekend can you tell us sir were there any deals made i spoke to a lot of leaders european asian from all over the world they re dying to make a deal but i said we re not gonna have deficits with your country we re not gonna do that because to me a deficit is a loss we re gonna have surpluses who are at worst gonna be breaking even but china would be the worst uh in the group because the deficit is so big and when it s not sustainable and you know i was elected on this this was one of the biggest reasons i got elected it s exactly because of this that we re gonna put tariffs and we ve already put em on it s not a question of we will we re gonna put em on and those tariffs next year will make us $ trillion in addition to the $ trillion thousands of companies are gonna relocate back into the united states in north carolina already furniture people are starting to move back in in uh detroit and michigan which i won because of what i said what i m telling you uh car companies are starting to open up in indiana a big one is under construction as an example honda but they re moving in like nobody s ever seen this before so it s unsustainable for us to allow china to have surpluses of $ trillion we will be taking in over $ trillion over the next short period of time with the tariffs that i ve already instituted they re already in place now what s going to happen with the market i can t tell you but i can tell you our country has gotten a lot stronger and eventually it ll be a country like no other it ll be the most dominant country economically in the world mr president which is what it should be is there trump put though is there a mark is there pain in the market at some point you re unwilling to tolerate this idea of a trump put is there a threshold i think your question is so stupid but i mean i don t want anything to go down but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something and we have such a horrible we have been treated so badly by other countries because we had stupid leadership that allowed this to happen they took our businesses they took our money they took our jobs they moved it to mexico they moved it to canada they moved a lot of it to china and it s not sustainable we re not going to do it now we have hundreds of billions of dollars is pouring into our country on a monthly basis it s pouring in it s already started because i put tariffs on and eventually it s going to straighten out and our country will be solid and strong again elon musk has said he hopes for zero tariffs between the us and europe is that a place you d like to also get to well the problem is that europe has made a fortune with us you know europe also has had a tremendous uh surplus with the united states europe has treated us it s a little smaller but it they ve

/Users/samantha/Desktop/speech text data/rollcall (5).csv,"Hello everybody.
Hi, Mr. President.
How are you, Mr. President?
Nice to see you.
Nice to see you.
We haven't -- [Inaudible] I haven't seen you in a while.
Nice to see you as well.
5 million. For $5 million, this could be yours. That was the first of the cards. See that? Do you know what that card is?
Gold card.
It's the gold card. It's the Trump card. Gold card.
Who's the first buyer?
Me. I'm the --
Who's the second? (laughs)
-- first. I don't know, but I'm the first buyer. It'll be out in about less than two weeks probably. Pretty exciting, really.
You ready for some questions?
Anybody wanna buy one? Huh? Okay, let's go.
First, we'd love to get your reaction, sir, to what's going on in the financial markets today.
Well, I mean, it's to be expected. We're, uh, this is a patient that was very sick. We inherited -- we really inherited a terrible economy, as you know, with a lot of problems including, uh, loss of manufacturing and plants closed up all over the country. You know, we've lost 90,000 plants since NAFTA, if you think of that. 90,000. It's not even believable, and about 6 million jobs.
And so, it's a sick -- it was a sick patient that went through an operation on Liberation Day. And it's gonna be, uh, it's gonna be a booming country, a very booming country. It's gonna be amazing actually. And we see it because we have, uh, trillions of dollars committed to come in. Trillions.
Sir, can I ask you, when you say that it was an operation and the patient's healthy now, does that mean you see us as kind of towards the -- the high-water market --
Yeah, I think the operation --
-- in terms of how high?
Sure. Uh, the operation's over and now we, uh, let it settle in. You see the plants are starting to construction already. We have many plants. Uh, Indiana, massive auto plant. The Honda. And we have so many, uh, so many plants and they'll be under construction. And as they start to build, you're gonna see a lot of construction jobs and you're gonna see a lot of jobs when they open.
Does that mean chips and pharma tariffs are not --
No, they're --
-- on the table?
-- starting very soon. Uh, the chips, uh, are starting very soon. Uh, the, uh, pharma is, uh, going to be, uh, starting to come in, I think at a level that you haven't really seen before. We are, uh, looking at pharma right now, pharmaceuticals. It- it's a separate category, and we'll be announcing that sometime in the near future, not too distant future.
Are you negotiating --
That's under review right now.
Are you negotiating with partners currently?
Uh, what we have is we have a set of tariffs based on, uh, what they've been charging us. That's reciprocal. And those, uh, tariffs have come in, and many, e- every country's called us. That's the beauty of what we do. Uh, we put ourselves in the driver's seat. If we would've asked, uh, some of these country, almost most of these countries to do us a favor, they would've said, ""No."" Now they'll do anything for us. But, uh, we have, uh, tariffs.
They've been set and it's gonna make our country very rich.
Are you open to deals with these countries if they're calling you?
Well, it depends. If somebody said that, ""We're gonna give you something that's so phenomenal,"" as long as they're giving us something that's good. For instance, uh, with TikTok as an example, we have a situation with TikTok where China will probably say, ""We'll approve a deal, but will you do something on the tariff?"" The tariffs give us great power to negotiate, always have.
I've used it very well in the first administration, as you saw. But now we're taking it to a whole new level because it's a worldwide situation and it's, uh, it's very exciting to see. And what it's done is driven a lot of great companies to our country. And you're gonna see construction starting all over.
I already got a couple of calls from Lee Zeldin from Environmental. He's got some big plans to approve, like really big ones.
Mr. President --
[Crosstalk]
How long will it -- how long will it take to get manufacturing, American manufacturing to where you would like to see it?
Well, let's say it's a two-year process. You know, they start a plant and they're big plants. We're giving them approval to also, in many cases, to build the electric facility with it. So you have electric generation and the plant, and they're big plants. Now, the good news is a lot of money for 'em, and they could build them fast but they're still very big plants.
So I'd always say it would take a year-and-a-half to two years.
Mr. President, can I ask you about the MSA?
Mr. President, I'm curious. Have you --
We've already started some of them.
Where's that?
Have you been following the New York City mayor's race? And specifically, Andrew Cuomo is now the front-runner according to the polls. How do you feel about that? Do you think you could have a good relationship with a Mayor Andrew Cuomo?
Well, I've always gotten along with him. We had our ins and outs a little bit. We did a great job for him. Remember we built, uh, the convention center rooms for him. He didn't use them unfortunately. And we sent the Mercy Ship. We sent the really magnificent hospital ship and they didn't use it. But we always had a pretty good relationship.
Are you going to make an endorsement in that race?
Oh, it's not something I'm thinking about yet. Is he thinking about running? Yeah?
On Russia, Ukraine, there's a Russian envoy in town for some meetings. Can you give us an update on how that's going?
We do. We have an envoy from Russia. We're talking about it. We'd like to see that stop as soon as possible. Because uh, thousands of people are being killed a week. Soldiers, mostly soldiers. And Ukrainian soldiers and Russian soldiers. And you're losing 2000, 3000 sometimes a week. So we -- we're, you know, spearheading the drive to get it done.
Uh, Europe has not been successful in dealing with President Putin, but I think I will be successful.
Sir, can I ask you about the NSC? How many staffers were let go and why? Your National Security Council? How many staffers we let --
Oh, there were some. There were some. Always we're gonna let go of people. People that we, uh, don't like, or people that we don't think can do -- do the job or people that may have loyalties to somebody else. You'll always -- you'll always have that.
So you mentioned on Yahoo recently, Israel has now talked about staying in Gaza during long-term occupation. Has anything changed in regard to the US-Gaza-Israel plans?
I spoke to him today, as a matter of fact, and I think he's gonna be coming to our country sometime in the not-too-distant future, maybe next week. And we'll speak about Israel and we'll speak about what's going on. That's another thing we'd like to get solved and I think we will get it solved. But I think --
So can I --
I think he very well may be coming next week.
Who -- who's going to be coming?
Benjamin Netanyahu?
Sir, can I follow up on your earlier comment about TikTok? You said that the Chinese might be willing to agree to a- approve that sale in exchange for tariff relief. Is that something that you've floated to them or you've heard from them, or?
No. No. I'm just using that as an example. Let's say we had a problem with TikTok and let's say China wasn't going to approve and we could use tariffs in order to get it approved. You know, you- you give them something in return.
What's the update on the deal negotiations for TikTok?
We're -- uh, We're very close to a deal with a very good group of people for TikTok,
Larry Ellison and all. Is it multiple investors or just --
Multiple.
And then did the last-minute bids kind of throw things into disarray for you or do you have your strategy completely locked up on who's gonna --
Which last minute? Which --
On -- on -- on acquiring TikTok?
No, I think -- I think --
Like you said, last minute --
-- that they could -- they could -- uh, China maybe will call and say, well, we're upset with the tariffs and maybe they want to get something a little bit in order to get TikTok approved. Who knows?
But is there any plans underway for you to share?
That's -- I have no knowledge of that. But that's the kind of thing --
On Israel, can you give us any update on the Palestinian relocation plan? Are there -- are we talking to any countries that --
Well, we're gonna try and solve the Gaza problem? It's been a problem for many years. For many, many decades. It's been a big problem. We have -- I've met with, as you know, a lot of the hostages. It's a terrible situation. But uh, if you notice, hostages are being released now, and that's happened only since I got involved.
So we have hostages being released. Quite a few actually.
Are you still committed to the relocation?
I'd like to get as many hostages as we can. And then Gaza -- Gaza is a very, uh, very important thing. It's, uh, it's been under siege for many, many years and it's a shame. It's a shame. A lot of people die in Gaza. Gaza's been a place we have and a lot of people die. A lot of bad things happen in Gaza.
We'll see what we can do about it.
The dinner tonight, can you tell us about it? Who's going to be there? Any leaders?
So dinner tonight is, uh, sort of a -- I have a couple of them actually. But, uh, a lot of it's based around charity. It's at Dural, and we raised a lot of money for charities. Uh, we're gonna also have to having one of the big golf tourn- professional golf tournaments they, LIV, and that'll take place over the next few days at Dural from, uh, I guess tomorrow until they have -- I think they have a pro app right now.
But I'll be speaking tonight, I think I'm making a speech to the players, great players. Some of the best players in the world. And ultimately, hopefully the two -- the two tours are going to merge. That would be good. I'm involved in that too. Uh, but hopefully we're going to get the two tours to merge.
You have the PGA Tour, you have the LIV Tour, and I think having them merge would be a great thing.
Mr. President, uh, about the tariffs. Do you have any message for the American far -- American businesses that might feel the impact of any reciprocal tariffs coming from the EU, for example, or from other countries?
I think it's going to all work out. Remember, there are no tariffs if you build your plant or you build your product, make your product in the US. And so, a lot of people, I mean, there's going to be a transition period because they're gonna be building instead of paying tariffs to some other place. And, but there are no tariffs.
You know, if you think there are no tariffs, all you have to do is build and make your product in the United States. So it's, uh, and a lot of people are doing that. The, uh, they're moving, like, the auto companies. I know I spoke to two of the four or five that are really active, and they've already started moving their parts, making things out of Mexico, out of Canada and into the United States.
Sir, did you speak to any CEOs today?
Sir, do you have a sense of how, how long, uh, Elon Musk's mission will last and when he will depart?
Well, Elon is fantastic and I think it's, you know, he's a patriot and I think it's a shame what they're doing with, uh, his car company and a great car. It's a great car, a great product, uh, and it tells you what a patriot he is. He's amazing. No, I mean, as long as he'd like, I like, I like smart people and he's a smart person.
I also like him personally. When he endorsed me, that's when I really got to know him. I knew him a little bit before that, but not much. And then he endorsed me, and it was a very strong embracing endorsement as we all know. And, uh, I would say, Elon will stay for a certain period of time, and then he's going to want to get back to his businesses full time.
But, he's done a fantastic job. We found 100s of, think of it, just 100s of, we've had millions of dollars of fraud and abuse and waste and, uh, they're still going. I mean, they're going strong. They're finding, they found something today that's horrible. It's horrible.
So, what was it? So, what --
So what they found, you'll find out very soon. What they found is incredible, and, uh, I give him a lot of credit. He's got some very smart people with him.
Do you think he could finish --
-- and they're working very closely with our secretaries, and our, the people that are the heads of the [Inaudible]
Do you think he could finish -- Do you think you would appoint him to another position once his 130 days --
Well, I would, I would. I think Elon's great, but he also has a, a company to run, or a number of companies to run. That he can do this, that he can find the time, he loves the country, that's why he does it. But, uh, we're in no rush, but there'll be a point at which time Elon's gonna have to leave.
Sir, you mentioned the auto companies -- But then, do you know what date, the specific date on when he's out?
No, but I, I would think a few months.
Even when he, uh, even when Elon leaves and goes back to being CEO, um, will DOGE stick around in some kind of capacity?
Yeah, it'll still, uh, DOGE, DOGE yourself? Yeah, a -- at some point --
[Inaudible]
-- uh, just so you understand, and I know you're getting it wrong, I want Elon to stay as long as possible. Number one, I like him. Number two, he's doing a great job. Number three, he is a patriot, that's why he's doing this. And he's, you know, it's very costly for him. But, uh, so I want him to stay as long as possible, but there'll be a point where he's gonna have to leave.
And when he does, the secretaries will take totally over and DOGE will stay active. Uh, we have a lot of smart people. A lot of those people I believe are gonna go into the agencies, and they'll work on it from the inside.
You mentioned auto companies that you've been speaking with. Have you spoken to any executives today?
Yeah.
Who?
I don't want to say who, but I speak to a lot of the auto executives. But, we have much more than autos. We have chips coming in. We have steel coming in.
But, did they call asking for exempt status?
The steel factories, the steel factories are opening up and expanding at levels that people have not seen also.
Can you tell us a little bit about your meeting with Laura Loomer and, uh, Mike Waltz today and how that came about?
So, Laura Loomer is a very good patriot. She is a very, uh, strong person, and I saw her yesterday for a little while. She has re- she makes recommendations of things and people, and sometimes I listen to those recommendations like I do with everybody. I listen to everybody, and then I make a decision. But, uh, I saw her yesterday, she was at the ceremony and uh, she has, she'll always have something to say, usually very constructive.
What did she recommend?
Uh, she recommended certain people for jobs.
Adding, adding to the administration, and not --
Adding.
Who, who did she recommend?
-- but not firing?
Well, she'll recommend that too --
But, who --
-- but yesterday she recommended some people for jobs.
Did she have anything to do with the NSC aids who were ousted?
No, no, not at all.
Do, do you know how many, sir? Do you know how many from the NSC?
Not many, very few.
Was it five, a dozen?
I really don't know.
Who does Loomer want --
There were, there were --
[Crosstalk]
Who did, who did Laura recommend hiring?
Well, I don't wanna say that, but she's, uh, she's recommended some good people over the years. She's been, she's been in the party a long time. She's done a good job.
Do you trust your national security staff is, is doing what you want them to do?
Yeah, I, I, yeah, sure. I do. We've, uh, done very well. We've had big success with the hoodies, as you probably know. Uh, nobody's been able to do it like us. And uh, they were shooting the boats out of the water, they were sinking ships. That's what they do. They're getting a big charge out of sinking ships.
And unfortunately they're associated with Iran very close, so they have to stop that. But we've hit them very hard and we've been hitting them very --
Sir, did you talk to Congresswoman Luna about her resolution to get maternity --
Congresswoman who?
For Congresswoman about her resolution to allow proxy voting for new mothers? Did you speak to [Inaudible]
I did. I did. And I would say this, I guess there's two sides to it, right? It's a little controversial. I don't know why it's controversial. I think she's great. Uh, Anna.
Do you support her?
I, I, I --
[Inaudible]
I think, uh, that, and I'm gonna let the speaker make the decision, but I like the idea of being able to -- if you're having a baby, I think you should be able to call in and vote. I, I'm in favor of that, but I understand some people aren't. I'm not involved in the issue, but I did, I spoke to Anna yesterday and she and some people feel strongly about it. And uh, I would agree with them, yeah.
Sir, you mentioned Iran. They have come out and said if they're gonna sit down with the US, they wanna use an intermediary, and I believe the US wanted direct talks. Would you still be willing to talk to them by an intermediary?
I, I think it's better if we have direct talks. I think it goes faster and you understand the other side a lot better than if you go through intermediaries.
Did you --
They wanna use, they wanted to use intermediaries. I don't, I don't think that's necessarily true anymore. I think they're concerned. I think they feel vulnerable and I don't want them to feel that way. And I think they wanna meet, yeah. Iran, they're talking about Iran.
You said you don't think they wanna use intermediaries anymore. Did they send another letter?
Yeah.
Did the UAE let you know about this?
Yeah. I, I, I know for a fact. I think they'd like to have direct talks.
Can you say anything about what the letter said from Iran?
No, I just think they, I'm just telling you, I think they wanna have -- forget about letters, I think they wanna have direct talks.
On Pete Hegseth and this IG investigation, do you want to weigh in on that one?
Wh- What is it?
There's an IG investigation into the Secretary of Defense's use of, of some -- the Signal app.
Oh, I don't know. Is that -- you're bringing that up again, don't bring that up again. Your editors probably. That's such a wasted story. So what else?
Chinese farmland. Um, do you have some plans for Chinese ownership of, of farmland in the, the US?
Oh, we look at that all the time. And look, I have a very good relationship with China and with the president, do have a lot of respect for President Xi. So, you know, we look at that all the time.
Yeah --
Farmland, it's been an issue for years. It's been, people have talked about it for years, but I have a lot of respect for China and I have a lot of respect for President Xi.
When's the last time you talked to President Xi?
I speak to, uh, doesn't matter when, but I speak to him.
Sir -- Have you talked to Zelenskyy recently?
Not too long ago, yeah.
How did that go?
Good. I think he's ready to make a deal.
New progress though, other than that?
I think a lot of progress. No, he's, he's ready to make a deal and I think that President Putin is ready, ready to make a deal. And then you'll stop the killing of thousands of young people a week.
Did Kirill Dmitriev say that to your, uh, counter, to his counterparts in the US?
Who?
Kirill Dmitriev, the Russian negotiator that's in Washington right now?
I don't talk about specific people. I just will tell you that there's a lot of good conversation going on about Ukraine and Russia.
Sir -- Have you given your approval for the UK's deal over the Chagos Island that Prime Minister Starmer and you discussed?
I'm talking to the Prime Minister about it and we'll see how that turns out. He's uh, we have a very good dialogue going.
Sir --
And I think he was very happy about how we treated them on tariffs, so --
Sir, there a lot of people were upset about how --
Who are you with?
They Daily Mail. A lot of people were upset today about how their 401K's were doing. Do you have investments, were you looking at them? Are you worried?
Uh, I think the, I think our markets are gonna boom. Gotta give it a little chance, but we're taking in jobs and we're taking in industry and we're taking in trillions of dollars. I think, I think our markets are gonna boom, try to give it a little bit of time. Uh, but they've already started construction on numerous plants.
Soon it'll be many, many plants. All over the country, they're going. So, so you got to give --
Are you [Inaudible] your 401K?
You got to give that, you got to give that a little. I haven't checked my 401K. (laughing) Thank you very much everybody.
Sir, sir. One question on the Fed. A lot of money markets are now [Inaudible] Fed cuts this year.
Well, one thing I like is interest rates going down, you see that happening. And interest --
The 10 year yield is right below 4%.
You know what's beautiful is interest rates go down. I like, uh, I like groceries going down, I like eggs going down. If you look at it, and, uh, very importantly, the gasoline prices are going down. So a lot of good things are happening. Thank you very much.
Thank you for your time, Mr. President.",10,hello everybody hi mr president how are you mr president nice to see you nice to see you we haven t inaudible i haven t seen you in a while nice to see you as well million for $ million this could be yours that was the first of the cards see that do you know what that card is gold card it s the gold card it s the trump card gold card who s the first buyer me i m the who s the second laughs first i don t know but i m the first buyer it ll be out in about less than two weeks probably pretty exciting really you ready for some questions anybody wanna buy one huh okay let s go first we d love to get your reaction sir to what s going on in the financial markets today well i mean it s to be expected we re uh this is a patient that was very sick we inherited we really inherited a terrible economy as you know with a lot of problems including uh loss of manufacturing and plants closed up all over the country you know we ve lost plants since nafta if you think of that it s not even believable and about million jobs and so it s a sick it was a sick patient that went through an operation on liberation day and it s gonna be uh it s gonna be a booming country a very booming country it s gonna be amazing actually and we see it because we have uh trillions of dollars committed to come in trillions sir can i ask you when you say that it was an operation and the patient s healthy now does that mean you see us as kind of towards the the high water market yeah i think the operation in terms of how high sure uh the operation s over and now we uh let it settle in you see the plants are starting to construction already we have many plants uh indiana massive auto plant the honda and we have so many uh so many plants and they ll be under construction and as they start to build you re gonna see a lot of construction jobs and you re gonna see a lot of jobs when they open does that mean chips and pharma tariffs are not no they re on the table starting very soon uh the chips uh are starting very soon uh the uh pharma is uh going to be uh starting to come in i think at a level that you haven t really seen before we are uh looking at pharma right now pharmaceuticals it it s a separate category and we ll be announcing that sometime in the near future not too distant future are you negotiating that s under review right now are you negotiating with partners currently uh what we have is we have a set of tariffs based on uh what they ve been charging us that s reciprocal and those uh tariffs have come in and many e every country s called us that s the beauty of what we do uh we put ourselves in the driver s seat if we would ve asked uh some of these country almost most of these countries to do us a favor they would ve said no now they ll do anything for us but uh we have uh tariffs they ve been set and it s gonna make our country very rich are you open to deals with these countries if they re calling you well it depends if somebody said that we re gonna give you something that s so phenomenal as long as they re giving us something that s good for instance uh with tiktok as an example we have a situation with tiktok where china will probably say we ll approve a deal but will you do something on the tariff the tariffs give us great power to negotiate always have i ve used it very well in the first administration as you saw but now we re taking it to a whole new level because it s a worldwide situation and it s uh it s very exciting to see and what it s done is driven a lot of great companies to our country and you re gonna see construction starting all over i already got a couple of calls from lee zeldin from environmental he s got some big plans to approve like really big ones mr president crosstalk how long will it how long will it take to get manufacturing american manufacturing to where you would like to see it well let s say it s a two year process you know they start a plant and they re big plants we re giving them approval to also in many cases to build the electric facility with it so you have electric generation and the plant and they re big plants now the good news is a lot of money for em and they could build them fast but they re still very big plants so i d always say it would take a year and a half to two years mr president can i ask you about the msa mr president i m curious have you we ve already started some of them where s that have you been following the new york city mayor s race and specifically andrew cuomo is now the front runner according to the polls how do you feel about that do you think you could have a good relationship with a mayor andrew cuomo well i ve always gotten along with him we had our ins and outs a little bit we did a great job for him remember we built uh the convention center rooms for him he didn t use them unfortunately and we sent the mercy ship we sent the really magnificent hospital ship and they didn t use it but we always had a pretty good relationship are you going to make an endorsement in that race oh it s not something i m thinking about yet is he thinking about running yeah on russia ukraine there s a russian envoy in town for some meetings can you give us an update on how that s going we do we have an envoy from russia we re talking about it we d like to see that stop as soon as possible because uh thousands of people are being killed a week soldiers mostly soldiers and ukrainian soldiers and russian soldiers and you re losing sometimes a week so we we re you know spearheading the drive to get it done uh europe has not been successful in dealing with president putin but i think i will be successful sir can i ask you about the nsc how many staffers were let go and why your national security council how many staffers we let oh there were some there were some always we re gonna let go of people people that we uh don t like or people that we don t think can do do the job or people that may have loyalties to somebody else you ll always you ll always have that so you mentioned on yahoo recently israel has now talked about staying in gaza during long term occupation has anything changed in regard to the us gaza israel plans i spoke to him today as a matter of fact and i think he s gonna be coming to our country sometime in the not too distant future maybe next week and we ll speak about israel and we ll speak about what s going on that s another thing we d like to get solved and i think we will get it solved but i think so can i i think he very well may be coming next week who who s going to be coming benjamin netanyahu sir can i follow up on your earlier comment about tiktok you said that the chinese might be willing to agree to a approve that sale in exchange for tariff relief is that something that you ve floated to them or you ve heard from them or no no i m just using that as an example let s say we had a problem with tiktok and let s say china wasn t going to approve and we could use tariffs in order to get it approved you know you you give them something in return what s the update on the deal negotiations for tiktok we re uh we re very close to a deal with a very good group of people for tiktok larry ellison and all is it multiple investors or just multiple and then did the last minute bids kind of throw things into disarray for you or do you have your strategy completely locked up on who s gonna which last minute which on on on acquiring tiktok no i think i think like you said last minute that they could they could uh china maybe will call and say well we re upset with the tariffs and maybe they want to get something a little bit in order to get tiktok approved who knows but is there any plans underway for you to share that s i have no knowledge of that but that s the kind of thing on israel can you give us any update on the palestinian relocation plan are there are we talking to any countries that well we re gonna try and solve the gaza problem it s been a problem for many years for many many decades it s been a big problem we have i ve met with as you know a lot of the hostages it s a terrible situation but uh if you notice hostages are being released now and that s happened only since i got involved so we have hostages being released quite a few actually are you still committed to the relocation i d like to get as many hostages as we can and then gaza gaza is a very uh very important thing it s uh it s been under siege for many many years and it s a shame it s a shame a lot of people die in gaza gaza s been a place we have and a lot of people die a lot of bad things happen in gaza we ll see what we can do about it the dinner tonight can you tell us about it who s going to be there any leaders so dinner tonight

/Users/samantha/Desktop/speech text data/rollcall (6).csv,"Thank you very much. Thank you. Nice crowd. What a good-looking group of people. Well, we have some very, very good news today and a lot of good things are happening for our country. Please sit down. My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day. Waiting for a long time, April 2nd, 2025 will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed and the day that we began to make America wealthy again.
We're going to make it wealthy, good and wealthy. For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike. American steelworkers, auto workers, farmers and skilled craftsmen, we have a lot of them here with us today. They really suffered gravely.
They watched in anguish as foreign leaders have stolen our jobs, foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream. We had an American dream that you don't hear so much about. You did four years ago and you are Now, but you don't too often.
And for many years and decades, even, you didn't hear too much about. Our country and its taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, but it is not going to happen anymore. It's not going to happen. In a few moments, I will sign a historic executive order instituting reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world, reciprocal.
That means they do it to us and we do it to them, very simple, can't get any simpler than that. This is one of the most important days, in my opinion, in American history. It's our declaration of economic independence. For years, hardworking American citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense, but now it's our turn to prosper.
And in so, doing use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt and it will all happen very quickly. with today's action, we are finally going to be able to make America great again, greater than ever before. Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country and you see it happening already.
We will supercharge our domestic industrial base. We will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers and ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers. This will be indeed the golden age of America. It's coming back and we're going to come back very strongly.
We're pleased to be joined on this momentous occasion by Vice President J.D. Vance. J.D., thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Where are you J.D.? Oh, that wasn't too hard to find. I was looking. He likes to take a low-key attitude, usually, be sitting right in front. He's gaining a lot of confidence, Mike, isn't he? And nearly my entire cabinet is here, as well as speaker Mike Johnson, who's done an amazing job.
And with the great success we had last night in Florida, we have a majority of seven. And seven's like a lot where we had it at one, right? You've done a fantastic job and many of the members of the House and Senate are with us, Senators, Congressmen, thank you all for being with us. We appreciate it. For decades, the United States slashed our trade barriers on other countries, while those nations placed massive tariffs on our products and created outrageous, non-monetary barriers to decimate our industries.
And in many cases, the nonmonetary barriers were worse than the monetary ones. They manipulated their currencies, subsidized their exports, stole our intellectual property, imposed exorbitant VAT taxes to disadvantage our products, adopted unfair rules and technical standards and created filthy pollution havens.
They were absolutely filthy, but they always came to us and they said we're violating, we should pay for it. It's all detailed in a very big report by the U.S. trade representative on foreign trade barriers and I'll just hold it up for you. It's available and you don't have to pay too much. As I understand it, you'll pay nothing.
It's a lot of work, a lot of work for something, actually, because it's a special book. It's very, frankly, it's very upsetting when you read it, when you see what people have been doing to us for 30 years. This all happened with no response from the United States of America, none whatsoever. But those days are over.
Let me offer just a few examples of the vicious attacks our workers have faced for so many years. The United States charges other countries only a 2.4 tariff on motorcycles. Meanwhile, Thailand and others are charging much higher prices, like 60 percent. India charges 70 percent. Vietnam charges 75 percent, and others are even higher than that.
Likewise, until today, the United States has, for decades, charged a 2.5 tariff. Think of that, 2.5 percent on foreign made automobiles. The European Union charges us more than 10 percent tariffs and they have 20 percent VATs, much, much higher. India charges 70 percent, and perhaps worst of all are the non-monetary restrictions imposed by South Korea, Japan and very many other nations as a result of these colossal trade barriers.
Eighty-one percent of the cars in South Korea are made in South Korea. 94 percent of the cars in Japan are made in Japan. Toyota sells one million foreign made automobiles into the United States and General Motors sells almost none. Ford sells very little. None of our companies are allowed to go into other countries.
And I say that, friend and foe, and in many cases the friend is worse than the foe in terms of trade. But such horrendous imbalances have devastated our industrial base and put our national security at risk. I don't blame these other countries at all for this calamity. I blame former presidents and past leaders who weren't doing their job.
They let it happen and they let it happen to an extent that nobody can even believe. That's why effective at midnight, we will impose a 25 percent tariff on all foreign made automobiles. Thank you. Brian, I'd like to have you come up here for a second, OK? I just see him sitting. He's been a fan of ours and he understands this business a lot better than the economists, a lot better than anybody.
Brian, say a few words, please, would you?
Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you. It's a great honor to have you. Thanks.
Thank you, Mr. President. I grew up just north of Detroit, Michigan, in Macomb County, known as the home of the Reagan democrats. My first vote for President was for Ronald Reagan. I thought that was going to be the best president I ever saw in my lifetime until Donald J. Trump came along. I have watched, my entire life, I have watched plant after plant after plant in Detroit and in the metro Detroit area close.
There are now plants sitting idle. There are now plants that are underutilized and Donald Trump's policies are going to bring product back into those underutilized plants. There's going to be new investment. There's going to be new plants built. And the UAW members, and I brought 20 of them with me, they're sitting right over here.
We support Donald Trump's policies on tariffs 100 percent. So Mr. President, we can't thank you enough. And in six months or a year, we're going to begin to see the benefits. I can't wait to see what's happening three or four years down the road. Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you so much. Thank you. What -- A great guy, he got it right from the beginning, he got it before almost anybody else. This group over there, they got it too. And you know, we won the state of Michigan, we won almost all of them, but we won Michigan by a lot. And I want to just thank you all. The autoworkers were fantastic, the Teamsters were fantastic.
Everyone was pretty good, I will tell you. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. You're going to be very happy very soon. And you probably see what's happening with all of the -- not only car companies, but car companies in particular. You see it with all of the ones they're moving, they're announcing day in, day out.
You're seeing it, nobody's ever seen anything like that with today's actions. We're also standing up for our great farmers and ranchers who are brutalized by nations all over the world. Brutalized. Canada, by the way, imposes a 250 percent to 300 percent tariff on many of our dairy products. They do the first -- the first can of milk.
They do the first little carton of milk at a very low price, but after that, it gets bad and then it gets up to 275 percent, 300 percent. So, when they're figuring what's Canada charging, they say, oh, about 2 percent, 3 percent. But take a look at what happens down the road when you look a little bit, it's not a pretty picture and we don't like it and it's not fair.
It's not fair to our farmers, it's not fair to our country. And with countries like Canada, you know we subsidize a lot of countries and keep them going and keep them in business. In the case of Mexico, it's $300 billion a year. In the case of Canada, it's close to $200 billion a year. And I say why are we doing this?
Why are we doing this? I mean, at what point do we say you've got to work for yourselves, and you've got to -- this is why we have the big deficits. This is why we have that amount of debt that's been placed on our heads over the last number of years, and we're really not taking it anymore. Through non-tariff barriers the European Union bans imports of most American poultry.
You understand. They say we want to send you our cars, we want to send you everything, but we're not going to take anything that you have. Australia bans -- and they're wonderful people and wonderful everything, but they ban American beef. Yet we imported $3 billion of Australian beef from them just last year alone.
They won't take any of our beef, they don't want it because they don't want it to affect their farmers. And you know what, I don't blame them. But we're doing the same thing right now, starting about midnight tonight, I would say. And China charges, American rice farmers and over quota, it's called, a tariff rate of 65 percent.
South Korea charges 50 -- actually they charge different, from 50 percent to 513 percent. And Japan, our friend, charges us 700 percent, but that's because they don't want us selling rice and other -- who can blame them, Madam Secretary, Agriculture. Great job you did on eggs, by the way, the egg prices came down 50 percent.
You got them down 50 percent. Once we got involved, they were going through the sky, the egg prices, they were going through the sky, and you did a fantastic job. Now we have lots of eggs and they're much cheaper, down about 59 percent now and they're going down further. We charge 2.8 percent for so many things that other countries are charging 200 percent, 300 percent and 400 percent for.
If imposing tariffs and protective barriers made nations poorer, then every country on earth would be racing to eliminate these policies and China would be the first in line. They run a very strong country, but they're not first in line. And the American people are paying a very big price. From 1789 to 1913, we were a tariff-backed nation, and the United States was proportionately the wealthiest it has ever been.
So wealthy, in fact, that in the 1880s, they established a commission to decide what they were going to do with the vast sums of money they were collecting. We were collecting so much money so fast we didn't know what to do with it. Isn't that a nice problem to have? What do you think, Marco? Good problem?
Marco would love that problem. But we don't have that problem anymore, but we're not going to have it very much longer, I will tell you. But they collected so much money, they actually formed a commission to determine what they were going to do with the money, who they were going to give it to and how much.
Then in 1913, for reasons unknown to mankind, they established the income tax so that citizens, rather than foreign countries, would start paying the money necessary to run our government. Then in 1929, it all came to a very abrupt end with the Great Depression, and it would have never happened if they had stayed with the tariff policy.
It would have been a much different story. They tried to bring back tariffs to save our country, but it was gone, it was gone, it was too late. Nothing could have been done. It took years and years to get out of that depression, far longer than even FDR -- had that office right over there for a long period of time.
The ramp system, that's rather intricate, was built because of him and every time you walk up, you think of him. And he did a great job in many ways, but it lasted long beyond his terms, as you know. But it's not too late any longer. And we're going to start being smart and we're going to start being very wealthy again.
We're going to be wealthy as a country because they've taken so much of our wealth away from us. We're not going to let that happen. We truly can be very wealthy. We can be so much wealthier than any country, it's not even believable, but we're getting smart. Nearly a century later in the face of unrelenting economic warfare, the United States can no longer continue with a policy of unilateral economic surrender.
We cannot pay the deficits of Canada, Mexico and so many other countries. We used to do it; we can't do it anymore. We take care of countries all over the world. We pay for their military; we pay for everything they have to pay. And then when you want to cut back a little bit, they get upset that you're not taking care of them any longer.
But we have to take care of our people and we're going to take care of our people first and I'm sorry to say that. And today we're standing up for the American worker and we are finally putting America first. In Sleepy Joe Biden's last year in office the United States hemorrhaged 100,000 manufacturing jobs and the number was going through the roof at levels never seen before.
And our trade deficit reached a record $1.2 trillion, which is unheard of, since the beginning of NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made. It was a horror show I was able to term it, and they all said you'd never be able to get it out. We had to get approval from congress to get it terminated. We had to live with that deal -- it was the worst deal, worst trade deal ever made by far.
But since the very beginning of NAFTA, our country lost 90,000 factories. Think of what that is, 90,000. Think about putting a map up and putting tacks on it, you wouldn't have enough room. 90,000, I said, is that possible? We had it checked four different times, and it was actually somewhat higher than that.
And 5 million manufacturing jobs were lost while racking up trade deficits of $19 trillion. That was the worst trade deal ever made. As a result of these gigantic losses, foreign nations now own $26 trillion more of American assets than American -- think of this, than the Americans own of their own foreign assets or other foreign assets.
The United States can no longer produce enough antibiotics to treat our sick. We have a tremendous problem. We have to go to foreign countries to treat our sick. If anything ever happened from a war standpoint, we wouldn't be able to do it. We import virtually all of our computers, phones, televisions and electronics.
We used to dominate the field and now we import it all from different countries. A single shipyard in China now produces more ships every year than all of the American shipyards combined. Think of that. And it was a business that we used to dominate, we used to dominate it totally. In short, chronic trade deficits are no longer merely an economic problem, they're a national emergency that threatens our security and our very way of life.
It's a very great threat to our country. And for these reasons starting tomorrow, the United States will implement reciprocal tariffs on other nations. It's been a long time since we even thought of that. We used to think about it a lot. We didn't think about it for many decades, and you see what's happened.
For nations that treat us badly, we will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating. And because we are being very kind, we're kind people, very kind -- you're not so kind when you got ripped off with your salaries, my auto worker friends and my Teamster friends and all of the unions that typically voted democrat, they're not voting democrat anymore because worker, whether union or non-worker, they're for the republicans now.
That's what happened. But we will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us. So, the tariffs will be not a full reciprocal I could have done that, yes, but it would have been tough for a lot of countries. We didn't want to do that. I'd like to see the chart, if you have it. Could you bring it up, Howard?
This is our great Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick. Thanks. So, if you look at that, China first row. China, 67 percent. That's tariffs charged to the U.S.A including currency manipulation and trade barriers. So, 67 percent, I think you can for the most part see it, those with good eyes. With bad eyes -- we didn't want to bring -- it's very windy out here.
We didn't want to bring out the big chart because it had no chance of standing. Fortunately, we came armed with a little smaller chart. [Laughter] So, it's 67 percent. So, we're going to be charging a discounted reciprocal tariff of 34 percent, I think. In other words, they charge us, we charge them. We charge them less, so how can anybody be upset?
They will be because we never charge anybody anything. But now we're going to charge. European Union, they're very tough, very, very tough traders. You think of European Union, very friendly. They rip us off. It's so sad to see. It's so pathetic. 39 percent, we're going to charge them 20 percent. So, we're charging them essentially half.
Vietnam, great negotiators, great people. They like me, I like them. The problem is they charge us 90 percent. We're going to charge them a 46 percent tariff. Taiwan, where they make -- they took all of our computer chips and semiconductors. We used to be the king, right? We were everything, we had all of it now.
We have almost none of it except the biggest company is coming in. They're going to have -- we're going to end up with almost 40 percent. Lee Zeldin is working to get their approvals and it's an amazing company. Mr. Wei, of one of the great companies of the world actually, they're coming in from Taiwan and they're going to build one of the biggest plants in the world, maybe the biggest for that.
But 64 percent, we're going to charge them 32 percent. Japan, very, very tough, great people. And again, I don't blame the people for doing it. It's -- I think they're very smart in doing it. I blame the people that sat right in that Oval Office right over there, right behind the Resolute Desk or whichever desk they chose.
Japan 46 percent, they would charge us 46 percent, and much higher for certain items like cars. You know, little items like cars. 46 percent, we're charging them 24 percent. India very, very tough -- very, very tough. The prime minister just left and he's a great friend of mine. But I said you're a friend of mine, but you're not treating us right.
They charge us 52 percent. You have to understand, we charge them almost nothing for years and years and decades. And it was only seven years ago when I came in, we started with China in charge, and we took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China in tariffs and they understood honestly. President Xi understood.
He said, look, I understand, and the other countries -- and they all understand, we're going to have to go through a little tough love maybe, but they all understand. They're ripping us off and they understood it. Prime minister of Japan, Shinzo, was Shinzo Abe. He was a fantastic man. He was unfortunately taken from us, assassination.
But I went to him and I said, Shinzo, we have to do something, trade is not fair. He said, I know that, I know that. And he was a great gentleman. He was a fantastic man, but he understood immediately what I was talking about. I said Shinzo, we have to do something. He said, I know that, and we worked out a deal and it would have been a much better deal.
But frankly, there were many years left on the deal that was made previous to my getting there. But it was something. If you look at Switzerland, 61 percent to 31 percent. Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia -- oh, look at Cambodia, 97 percent. We're going to bring it down to 49 percent. They made a fortune with the United States of America.
United Kingdom, 10 percent and we'll go 10 percent. So, we'll do the same thing. South Africa, oh, 60 percent, 30 percent. And they've got some bad things going on in South Africa. You know, we're paying them billions of dollars and we cut the funding because a lot of bad things are happening in South Africa.
The fake news ought to be looking at it. They don't want to report it. Brazil 10 percent, 10 percent. Bangladesh is 74 percent. So, you see what's going on. Pakistan, 58 percent. Sri Lanka, 88 percent. So, what we're doing is we're taking not the full -- we could take the full 88 percent. Thanks a lot. He's doing a very good job.
How is he doing? All right? I think you better take it with you, it's not going to last very long. He's going to put it -- it's going to follow you down with the wind. I brought a hat just in case it got too windy, but here, would anybody like a hat? I'm not giving it to a cabinet, I'm giving it to the auto workers.
Come here. Thank you, fellas. Get it. That's it. That's it. They deserve it more than our cabinet [Laughter]. Our cabinet has plenty of hats. But you see the numbers, the numbers are so disproportionate, they're so unfair. At the same time, we will establish a minimum baseline tariff of 10 percent. You notice that on the chart.
And that'll be on other countries to help rebuild our economy and to prevent cheating. So, we're going to have a minimum of cheating and we're going to be very severe on the people that -- at the gate that watch the tariffs and watch the product coming in because there's been a lot of bad things happening at the gate because the money is so enormous that you're talking about.
There's never been probably anything like it in terms of the enormity. And there are a lot of bad things happen at the people that do the check-in. And they're looking at 10-year jail sentences if they do play. We're going to treat them so good. But if they cheat, the repercussions are going to be extremely strong.
Foreign nations will finally be asked to pay for the privilege of access to our market, the biggest market in the world. We're right now the biggest market in the world. We had a great country four years ago in terms of the economics. We were doubling up on China, we were doing so well. Nobody was going to catch us, but so much of it slipped away over the last four years under Biden.
I campaigned on this policy throughout last year and today that promise was made and it was also a promise, as you know, that was kept. Promises made, promises kept. To any company that objects to our commonsense reciprocal tariffs -- again, reciprocal, back and forth, back and forth. And we -- I call this kind reciprocal.
This is not full reciprocal; this is kind reciprocal. But what we do is we cut it in half, we charge them. My answer is very simple if they complain, if you want your tariff rate to be zero, then you build your product right here in America. Because there is no tariff if you build your plant, your product in America.
And we've seen companies coming in like we've never seen before, likewise to all of the foreign presidents, prime ministers, kings, queens, ambassadors and everyone else who will soon be calling to ask for exemptions from these tariffs. I say terminate your own tariffs, drop your barriers, don't manipulate your currencies.
They manipulate their currencies like nobody can even believe which is a bad, bad thing and very devastating to us, and start buying tens of billions of dollars of American goods. Tariffs give our country protection against those that would do us economic harm. And many people were looking to do us economic harm.
Maybe not so obviously, but they were doing tremendous economic harm, but even more importantly, they will give us growth. These tariffs are going to give us growth like you haven't seen before, and it will be something very special to watch. I am so looking forward and, Brian, it's going to happen even faster than you said.
You know, you might say, but it's already started. It's already started. Work's already begun on plants all around the country and you see that it's before -- these are big, rich companies. We have $61 billion started on a big plant going up. It's going to be announced over the next two days, and they already started work.
Many of these biggest -- the biggest companies in the world, they've committed to build, build, build. We're going to build, build, build, sir. And they came here to see me and they came -- wanted to know if they could have a press conference. I do as many as I can. I'm pretty busy trying to stop Russia and Ukraine and the Middle East, we've got to stop that.
We've got to stop the Houthis, which we're making tremendous. They like shooting ships down and out of the water seeking ships, they get a kick out of it. But they're not getting such a kick out of it now. Are they, Mr. Secretary? They're not getting such a kick out of that now. But here's just a short list of some of the companies that have already announced and committed to investment.
And this is a company that built its factories and its plants in China. Apple is going to spend $500 billion. They never spent money like that here. They're going to build their plants here. SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle, great, great companies. -- are investing $500 billion almost immediately. Nvidia, a hot company, is investing hundreds of billions of dollars, they just announced.
TSMC, the biggest, most important company in the world of chips from Taiwan, with no investment from us, is investing $200 billion. And they said the reason was number one, the election of November 5th and number two, the tariffs. They don't want to pay the tariffs and the way they're not paying it is to build their plant here.
So we're going to go from almost no percentage. We used to have 100 percent of the chip market. Now it's all in Taiwan. Almost all of it's in Taiwan, a couple of other countries, but mostly in Taiwan. And think of it, we had 100 percent. We lost it because of people in that office that didn't do their job.
They allowed it to be stolen from us. Johnson & Johnson, great company $55 billion. Eli Lilly, $27 billion. Meta is investing $500 billion. Wow. DAMAC is investing $20 billion. CMA CGM, $20 billion. And then you have Merck and Clarios, Stellantis, General Motors, GE Aerospace, Honda, Nissan, Hyundai, are all putting in billions and billions of dollars and they're committed 100 percent.
And we've never had -- And this is after two and a half months. This is after just a short -- this all took place as soon as we came out with what everybody wanted to do. I watched a gentleman today on television, used to work with Lee Iacocca, very respected automobile person. And he said, because they're asking people are they try and get as many negative people as they can, but they can't find them too much.
It's pretty hard to find in terms of what we're doing, especially when they see all this investment. They said, so tell me, what do you think of what Trump is doing from the automobile standpoint? He said, I can't believe it. Somebody is finally -- he's an older guy, real pro, really top guy with Lee Iacocca, he said, I never thought I'd see the day when this would happen, where somebody had the courage to go and do what has to be done.
This is transforming our nation. Our entire nation is going to be transformed, not only with the cars, but on every single other item that's built. And we're going to become an industrial powerhouse. And he said that so beautifully today. In fact, I'm going to find out -- I'm going to get a tape and Bruce, I'm going to get that tape and I'm going to send it to you out in Long Island and you're going to play it for the people, and all your union workers and your nonunion workers out there.
You got a pretty even split. But we have, so far, it looks like we're going to have about $6 trillion of investments. And you wouldn't do that in years in this country, over the last number of years, $6 trillion. And that's going to be much higher by the end of the year. And think of what $6 trillion is. You wouldn't have even a small percentage of that under this other system.
We're going to be an entirely different country and it's going to be fantastic for the workers. It's going to be fantastic for everyone. There will never have been a transformation of a country like the transformation that's already happening in the United States of America. It's an incredible thing to watch and it's incredible to meet with the top people, people that you read about, very wealthy people or people that are great managers and executives and presidents of big public companies.
And to watch the enthusiasm they have now that they didn't have. They gave up on our country, they went to foreign countries and they built. Companies are pouring into our country at levels never seen before, with jobs and money to follow and it's really beautiful. In the coming days, there will be complaints from the globalists and the outsourcers and special interests and the fake news.
The fake news will always complain. But never forget, every prediction our opponents made about trade for the last 30 years has been proven totally wrong. They were wrong about NAFTA. They were wrong about China. They were wrong about the Trans-Pacific partnership, which would have been a disaster if I didn't terminate it. If I didn't terminate that, United Auto Workers, you would have had no jobs in this country.
You would have had no jobs. It was all going to other countries. In my first term, they said tariffs would crash the economy. Instead, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And again, I have great respect for President Xi of China, great respect for China. But they were taking tremendous advantage of us. And I commend them for that.
I say, hey, if you can get away with it, that's OK. But they understand exactly what's happening and they probably, most of them are saying it's about time. They did something, and they're going to fight and they're going to fight fair. Everyone's going to fight. I say to the leaders, look, you got to take care of your country, but we have to start taking care of our country now.
We can't do what we've been doing for the last 50 years. From the day of my election, the stock market went up in my first term, 88 percent, with Nasdaq going up 155 percent, more than any president has ever had in any term in office by far. And I think we're going to blow that away and maybe the numbers won't show, but I think they're going to show much better than even those numbers.
But what you're going to see is you're going to see activity that empty, dead sites, factories that are falling down, those factories will be knocked down and they're going to have brand new factories built in their place. And not only talking about renovating, they're talking about brand new, the best anywhere in the world, the biggest anywhere in the world.
I have a friend who builds car plants and I said I want to see the biggest and the best he said, well, we have to go to Mexico. I said, no, I want to see it in the United States. He said, we're not building them in there. This is a year and a half ago. During the campaign, he said, we're not building, you'd have to go to Mexico.
When I was starting to decide to run and I went to number one in the polls, very rapidly, I want to say. I want to say, like, let's say in the first hour and then shortly thereafter it looked like I was going to win. And the fake news was saying, oh, no, don't do this. What they don't know is, if I didn't win, they would have really been in trouble because nobody wants to read them anyway.
But I tell you what, when it looked like I was going to win, I announced that I was going to be doing exactly what we're talking about today. Great consistency, actually, because I've been talking about it for 40 years, because I saw what was happening 40 years ago. If you look at my old speeches when I was young, very handsome, my old speeches and the people would say, I'd be on a television show.
I'd be talking about how we were being ripped off by these countries. I mean, nothing changes very much. The only thing that changed were the countries, but nothing really changes, but it's why it's such an honor, it's such an honor to be finally able to do this. If you look at China, I took in hundreds of billions of dollars in my term, hundreds of billions.
They never paid $0.10 to any other president and yet they paid hundreds of billions. So much so that Biden couldn't do anything. They wanted to try and terminate it because he had a very special relationship with China. You know what the relationship was, he had a special relationship -- but the numbers were so big.
The numbers were so big that they couldn't do it, so they did ease it up. They did things that they shouldn't have done. They made it a lot more comfortable for them, but they couldn't do it because the numbers were hundreds of billions of dollars. And I did that and we were on our way to doing something like incredible.
And then we had a very bad election happened, a very bad election. A lot of bad things happened. So when I said we got to do it again, I said, we have to make it too big to rig. And we made it too big to rig and we won in records and it was a monumental win. And it was such an honor to see so many of you, like Brian and your friends here with us to celebrate, and to more importantly celebrate what we're doing.
Because that wouldn't be a full celebration if we didn't do this because this would be an entirely different country in a short period of time. It will be something the whole world will be talking about. And the critics made the very tired predictions earlier this year. But in February, core inflation dropped to the lowest rate in four years.
And the price of eggs, as you know, just in a month and a half, we were there for four weeks and the first week, I got blamed for eggs. I said, I just got here. They said, eggs have gone up at like 250 percent and you can't get eggs. And they were going crazy. And I said, I just got here. And then we got to work on eggs and we got to work on everything and our great secretary of agriculture, you did a fantastic job, Brooke Rollins.
She did a fantastic job. And as I said before, the price of eggs dropped now 59 percent, and they're going down more and the availability is fantastic. They were saying that for Easter, please don't use eggs. Could you use plastic eggs? I said, we don't want to do that. And you really came through. It's an amazing job.
Thank you very much, Brooke. You did great. But likewise, an old-fashioned term that we use, groceries. I used it on the campaign. It's such an old-fashioned term but a beautiful term, groceries. It sort of says a bag with different things in it. Groceries went through the roof and I campaigned on that. I talked about the word groceries for a lot.
And energy costs now are down. Groceries are down. Gasoline is way under $3 and people are beginning to -- -- to be able to buy things and live again. We brought prices way down. We created 10,000, already in a few weeks, new manufacturing jobs and that took place in one month, numbers that they haven't seen in a long time.
We had virtually no inflation under my term. We had virtually no inflation for four years. But after transitioning over to Sleepy Joe, it went from almost nonexistent to the highest in the history of our country. They had the highest inflation in the history of our country, brought up by energy and bad spending and bad policy, and a lot of bad things happened.
How about allowing millions and millions and millions of people to pour into our country with open borders where the -- it's so sad to see even now. And I see our great secretary. You have done -- stand up, please, Kristi. Stand up. Kristi Noem and Tom Homan. These people are doing a great job, but uh gotten them out in records.
And we have problems with judges that don't want them to go out. They want Tren de Aragua and they want MS-13, the most vicious gangs ever. Nobody's ever seen anything like it, absolute killer gangs. They kill people, they don't even think about it and we put them out and we have judges now, radical left judges that they don't want them to go out, they want them to even be brought back.
Let's bring them back. You've done a fantastic job. And please thank everybody. Homeland security, thank everybody, appreciate it. And we now have a border that's the best border that we've ever had, even better than it was my first term. My first term, we did good, but this one we really specialized in. We've done really well and we had records then, with the best safest border.
Four years ago, we had the best border there ever was and now we have -- you've actually matched it and done even better and we're going to get it down the right way. And we want people, by the way, to come into our country, but we want them to come in through a legal process. We want them to come in legally.
We need more people. We need people to run these plants and to help the auto workers and the Teamsters and the nonunion people and everybody else, but we need people, and the farmers. And we're going to let people come in, but they want to come in. We want them to come in legally. They have to have the capability of loving our country, not people that hate our country.
We don't want them in our country. And now we're going to pass the largest tax cuts in American history, and that's where we're relying on Mike and John Thune. And we will not cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid benefits and the democrats will because if they got in, the entire economy would collapse.
This country was heading for a collapse under the people that you saw. They were horrible. I think one of the reasons people like the job -- I had my highest approval ratings because I think they're comparing me to the worst administration in the history of our country. So I appreciate that at least. But speaker of the House, Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader -- Appreciate it, Mike.
John Thune have been fantastic, by the way, but they've been working tirelessly on taking the next step to pass the plan for our one big beautiful bill. I'd like to name it that, if you can. I made that statement about six months ago and everybody calls it one big beautiful bill. And it will be that. It will have everything, the big tax cuts and every incentive there is and it will be a fantastic.
And by the way, for the cars we're asking for an interest deduction on a loan. So if you build the car -- only in America, we do it, Brian. If the car is not built in America, you don't get the interest rate deduction. But if you build the car in America, if you buy a car, if it's built in America, then you get an interest rate deduction, tax deduction.
And that's a big thing. It's going to be a big thing. I think that's going to pay for itself very quickly, that deduction, never happened. We've never had anything like that before. Somebody said where do you get the idea, because it's so basic you would think that would have happened a long time ago. It never did, and I'm very happy it didn't because now I can say that was my idea.
But we're going to get us closer to the debt extension. We have to get the debt extension passed and I know you're going to be able to do that, Mike, and it's very important that you do that. And all of the other things that the Senate budget plan gives us along with working -- because I know they're working together, John and Mike, and the two bills are going very well together.
We need to get our shared priorities done, including certain permanent tax cuts. We want the tax cuts to be permanent, spending cuts energy and historic investments in defense border and so much more. We're covering everything. These will be phenomenal. There'll be no, bill like this. It's going to straighten -- one bill is going to straighten out our country for many, many years to come.
And we said, let's just do it and let's get it done. And some guys will love it and some guys will like it a little bit less because they're not getting what they were exactly looking for. But they're getting a lot. If we get this done, it will be the most incredible bill ever passed in the history of our Congress and Senate and Congressman, the Senators and the Congressmen, many of whom are here today will be very proud of themselves.
I really believe that. It's going to set us on a whole new prosperous path. We're going to cut spending and right size the budget back to where it should be. We're going to do that very strongly. Thank you, Rick. Thank you, John. Thank you. Oh, look, look at all of our Senators over there. Oh, boy, that's a nice group of people, but I won't like them so much if they don't get this bill done.
That's a great group. And Congressman, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Tremendous people. The Senate plan is my complete and total support and the House plan, likewise, is very similar. They're moving along pretty much at the same clip. And as soon as you're ready, you'll show it to me and I'm sure it will have my support, Mike.
Every republican Congressman and Senator must unify. We have to unify. We can't be separated, we have to get it done. We have to get absolutely everything we can and we have to take care of the American people. That's the only thing that matters. We have to take care of the American people first. We need to pass this bill immediately.
Get it done, including debt extension. From this day on, we're not going to let anyone tell us that American workers and families cannot have the future that they deserve. We're going to produce the cars and ships, chips, airplanes, minerals and medicines that we need right here in America. The pharmaceutical companies are going to come roaring back.
They're coming roaring back. They're all coming back to our country, because if they don't, they've got a big tax to pay. And if they do, I'll be very happy and you're going to be very happy and you're going to be very safe. We're going to build our future with American hands, with American heart, American steel and we're going to build it with American pride like we used to. We're approaching our 100th day as president and have been given credit by a lot of people, actually, even some of the fake news.
Can you believe it? Which in this case, hopefully isn't fake, for having done more in that time than any other administration in the history of our country in the first 100 days. I think we've had an amazing, in terms of what we've done, what we've gotten accomplished. I'd like to see if we can get that war ended and another war from not starting in the Middle East.
We have to get Russia, they're losing 2,000, on average, 2,500 people a day, young people, soldiers, Russians. Think of that, 2,500 through some days but on average, probably over about a one-week period, it's 2,712. They say they're losing those soldiers. They're dying. They're being decimated. And they're not from our country, but they're from other countries.
But they're human beings. They're from Russia, they're from Ukraine in this period, most of them. And we're going to get it stopped. It's a senseless war that would have never happened if I was president and it shouldn't be allowed to go on. And I think we're being given good cooperation by Russia and by Ukraine.
But we have to get it stopped. It's humanity. It's humanity. It's a terrible thing. This will be a very big moment. I think you're going to remember today. It's going to be a free nation that we're dealing with. We're going to have a very free and beautiful nation. It's going to be Liberation Day in America and it's going to be a day that hopefully you're going to look back in years to come.
And you're going to say, he was right, this has turned out to be one of the most important days in the history of our country. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. This is Will, everybody. He's going to just give you a little bit -- he's going to give you a little bit of a briefing on what we're signing.
Good afternoon, you all. We have two documents prepared for the president's signature today. One closes what's referred to as the de minimis loophole, with respect to imports from the People's Republic of China. The other is -- is the big one, is the reciprocal tariff executive order that the president just spoke about at length.
This is obviously a huge deal and it's been an honor to be a part of your team getting this ready for you, sir.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Yes sir.
[The documents are signed]
This is big stuff. That's a 10. It's a good one. Look. [Inaudible] That's a good one. Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Okay, thank you very much. I'm going to hand out these pens now if I can. Come on over, yeah. Thank you very much.",11,thank you very much thank you nice crowd what a good looking group of people well we have some very very good news today and a lot of good things are happening for our country please sit down my fellow americans this is liberation day waiting for a long time april nd will forever be remembered as the day american industry was reborn the day america s destiny was reclaimed and the day that we began to make america wealthy again we re going to make it wealthy good and wealthy for decades our country has been looted pillaged raped and plundered by nations near and far both friend and foe alike american steelworkers auto workers farmers and skilled craftsmen we have a lot of them here with us today they really suffered gravely they watched in anguish as foreign leaders have stolen our jobs foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful american dream we had an american dream that you don t hear so much about you did four years ago and you are now but you don t too often and for many years and decades even you didn t hear too much about our country and its taxpayers have been ripped off for more than years but it is not going to happen anymore it s not going to happen in a few moments i will sign a historic executive order instituting reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world reciprocal that means they do it to us and we do it to them very simple can t get any simpler than that this is one of the most important days in my opinion in american history it s our declaration of economic independence for years hardworking american citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful much of it at our expense but now it s our turn to prosper and in so doing use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt and it will all happen very quickly with today s action we are finally going to be able to make america great again greater than ever before jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country and you see it happening already we will supercharge our domestic industrial base we will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers and ultimately more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers this will be indeed the golden age of america it s coming back and we re going to come back very strongly we re pleased to be joined on this momentous occasion by vice president j d vance j d thank you thank you thank you very much where are you j d oh that wasn t too hard to find i was looking he likes to take a low key attitude usually be sitting right in front he s gaining a lot of confidence mike isn t he and nearly my entire cabinet is here as well as speaker mike johnson who s done an amazing job and with the great success we had last night in florida we have a majority of seven and seven s like a lot where we had it at one right you ve done a fantastic job and many of the members of the house and senate are with us senators congressmen thank you all for being with us we appreciate it for decades the united states slashed our trade barriers on other countries while those nations placed massive tariffs on our products and created outrageous non monetary barriers to decimate our industries and in many cases the nonmonetary barriers were worse than the monetary ones they manipulated their currencies subsidized their exports stole our intellectual property imposed exorbitant vat taxes to disadvantage our products adopted unfair rules and technical standards and created filthy pollution havens they were absolutely filthy but they always came to us and they said we re violating we should pay for it it s all detailed in a very big report by the u s trade representative on foreign trade barriers and i ll just hold it up for you it s available and you don t have to pay too much as i understand it you ll pay nothing it s a lot of work a lot of work for something actually because it s a special book it s very frankly it s very upsetting when you read it when you see what people have been doing to us for years this all happened with no response from the united states of america none whatsoever but those days are over let me offer just a few examples of the vicious attacks our workers have faced for so many years the united states charges other countries only a tariff on motorcycles meanwhile thailand and others are charging much higher prices like percent india charges percent vietnam charges percent and others are even higher than that likewise until today the united states has for decades charged a tariff think of that percent on foreign made automobiles the european union charges us more than percent tariffs and they have percent vats much much higher india charges percent and perhaps worst of all are the non monetary restrictions imposed by south korea japan and very many other nations as a result of these colossal trade barriers eighty one percent of the cars in south korea are made in south korea percent of the cars in japan are made in japan toyota sells one million foreign made automobiles into the united states and general motors sells almost none ford sells very little none of our companies are allowed to go into other countries and i say that friend and foe and in many cases the friend is worse than the foe in terms of trade but such horrendous imbalances have devastated our industrial base and put our national security at risk i don t blame these other countries at all for this calamity i blame former presidents and past leaders who weren t doing their job they let it happen and they let it happen to an extent that nobody can even believe that s why effective at midnight we will impose a percent tariff on all foreign made automobiles thank you brian i d like to have you come up here for a second ok i just see him sitting he s been a fan of ours and he understands this business a lot better than the economists a lot better than anybody brian say a few words please would you thank you mr president thank you it s a great honor to have you thanks thank you mr president i grew up just north of detroit michigan in macomb county known as the home of the reagan democrats my first vote for president was for ronald reagan i thought that was going to be the best president i ever saw in my lifetime until donald j trump came along i have watched my entire life i have watched plant after plant after plant in detroit and in the metro detroit area close there are now plants sitting idle there are now plants that are underutilized and donald trump s policies are going to bring product back into those underutilized plants there s going to be new investment there s going to be new plants built and the uaw members and i brought of them with me they re sitting right over here we support donald trump s policies on tariffs percent so mr president we can t thank you enough and in six months or a year we re going to begin to see the benefits i can t wait to see what s happening three or four years down the road thank you mr president thank you so much thank you what a great guy he got it right from the beginning he got it before almost anybody else this group over there they got it too and you know we won the state of michigan we won almost all of them but we won michigan by a lot and i want to just thank you all the autoworkers were fantastic the teamsters were fantastic everyone was pretty good i will tell you thank you very much i appreciate it you re going to be very happy very soon and you probably see what s happening with all of the not only car companies but car companies in particular you see it with all of the ones they re moving they re announcing day in day out you re seeing it nobody s ever seen anything like that with today s actions we re also standing up for our great farmers and ranchers who are brutalized by nations all over the world brutalized canada by the way imposes a percent to percent tariff on many of our dairy products they do the first the first can of milk they do the first little carton of milk at a very low price but after that it gets bad and then it gets up to percent percent so when they re figuring what s canada charging they say oh about percent percent but take a look at what happens down the road when you look a little bit it s not a pretty picture and we don t like it and it s not fair it s not fair to our farmers it s not fair to our country and with countries like canada you know we subsidize a lot of countries and keep them going and keep them in business in the case of mexico it s $ billion a year in the case of canada it s close to $ billion a year and i say why are we doing this why are we doing this i mean at what point do we say you ve got to work for yourselves and you ve got to this is why we have the big deficits this is why we have that amount of debt that s been placed on our heads over the last number of years and we re really not taking it anymore through non tariff barriers the european union bans imports of most american poultry you understand they say we want to send you our cars we want to send you everything but we re not going to take anything that you have australia bans and they re wonderful people and wonderful everything but they ban american beef yet we imported $ billion of australian beef from them just last year alone they won t take any of our beef they don t want it because they don t want it to affect their farmers and you know what i don t blame them but we re doing the same thing right now starting about midnight tonight i would say and china charges american rice farmers and over quota it s called a tariff rate of percent south korea charges actually they charge different from percent to percent and japan our friend charges us percent but that s because they don t want us selling rice and other who can blame them madam secretary agriculture great job you did on eggs by the way the egg prices came down percent you got them down percent once we got involved they were going through the sky the egg prices they were going through the sky and you did a fantastic job now we have lots of eggs and they re much cheaper down about percent now and they re going down further we charge percent for so many things that other countries are charging percent percent and percent for if imposing tariffs and protective barriers made nations poorer then every country on earth would be racing to eliminate these policies and china would be the first in line they run a very strong country but they re not first in line and the american people are paying a very big price from to we were a tariff backed nation and the united states was proportionately the wealthiest it has ever been so wealthy in fact that in the s they established a commission to decide what they were going to do with the vast sums of money they were collecting we were collecting so much money so fast we didn t know what to do with it isn t that a nice problem to have what do you think marco good problem marco would love that problem but we don t have that problem anymore but we re not going to have it very much longer i will tell you but they collected so much money they actually formed a commission to determine what they were going to do with the money who they were going to give it to and how much then in for reasons unknown to mankind they established the income tax so that citizens rather than foreign countries would start paying the money necessary to run our government then in it all came to a very abrupt end with the great depression and it would have never happened if they had stayed with the tariff policy it would have been a much different story they tried to bring back tariffs to save our country but it was gone it was gone it was too late nothing could have been done it took years and years to get out of that depression far longer than even fdr had that office right over there for a long period of time the ramp system that s rather intricate was built because of him and every time you walk up you think of him and he did a great job in many ways but it lasted long beyond his terms as you know but it s not too late any longer and we re going to start being smart and we re going to start being very wealthy again we re going to be wealthy as a country because they ve taken so much of our wealth away from us we re not going to let that happen we truly can be very wealthy we can be so much wealthier than any country it s not even believable but we re getting smart nearly a century later in the face of unrelenting economic warfare the united states can no longer continue with a policy of unilateral economic surrender we cannot pay the deficits of canada mexico and so many other countries we used to do it we can t do it anymore we take care of countries all over the world we pay for their military we pay for everything they have to pay and then when you want to cut back a little bit they get upset that you re not taking care of them any longer but we have to take care of our people and we re going to take care of our people first and i m sorry to say that and today we re standing up for the american worker and we are finally putting america first in sleepy joe biden s last year in office the united states hemorrhaged manufacturing jobs and the number was going through the roof at levels never seen before and our trade deficit reached a record $ trillion which is unheard of since the beginning of nafta the worst trade deal ever made it was a horror show i was able to term it and they all said you d never be able to get it out we had to get approval from congress to get it terminated we had to live with that deal it was the worst deal worst trade deal ever made by far but since the very beginning of nafta our country lost factories think of what that is think about putting a map up and putting tacks on it you wouldn t have enough room i said is that possible we had it checked four different times and it was actually somewhat higher than that and million manufacturing jobs were lost while racking up trade deficits of $ trillion that was the worst trade deal ever made as a result of these gigantic losses foreign nations now own $ trillion more of american assets than american think of this than the americans own of their own foreign assets or other foreign assets the united states can no longer produce enough antibiotics to treat our sick we have a tremendous problem we have to go to foreign countries to treat our sick if anything ever happened from a war standpoint we wouldn t be able to do it we import virtually all of our computers phones televisions and electronics we used to dominate the field and now we import it all from different countries a single shipyard in china now produces more ships every year than all of the american shipyards combined think of that and it was a business that we used to dominate we used to dominate it totally in short chronic trade deficits are no longer merely an economic problem they re a national emergency that threatens our security and our very way of life it s a very great threat to our country and for these reasons starting tomorrow the united states will implement reciprocal tariffs on other nations it s been a long time since we even thought of that we used to think about it a lot we didn t think about it for many decades and you see what s happened for nations that treat us badly we will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs non monetary barriers and other forms of cheating and because we are being very kind we re kind people very kind you re not so kind when you got ripped off with your salaries my auto worker friends and my teamster friends and all of the unions that typically voted democrat they re not voting democrat anymore because worker whether union or non worker they re for the republicans now that s what happened but we will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us so the tariffs will be not a full reciprocal i could have done that yes but it would have been tough for a lot of countries we didn t want to do that i d like to see the chart if you have it could you bring it up howard this is our great secretary of commerce howard lutnick thanks so if you look at that china first row china percent that s tariffs charged to the u s a including currency manipulation and trade barriers so percent i think you can for the most part see it those with good eyes with bad eyes we didn t want to bring it s very windy out here we didn t want to bring out the big chart because it had no chance of standing fortunately we came armed with a little smaller chart laughter so it s percent so we re going to be charging a discounted reciprocal tariff of percent i think in other words they charge us we charge them we charge them less so how can anybody be upset they will be because we never charge anybody anything but now we re going to charge european union they re very tough very very tough traders you think of european union very friendly they rip us off it s so sad to see it s so pathetic percent we re going to charge them percent so we re charging them essentially half vietnam great negotiators great people they like me i like them the problem is they charge us percent we re going to charge them a percent tariff taiwan where they make they took all of our computer chips and semiconductors we used to be the king right we were everything we had all of it now we have almost none of it except the biggest company is coming in they re going to have we re going to end up with almost percent lee zeldin is working to get their approvals and it s an amazing company mr wei of one of the great companies of the world actually they re coming in from taiwan and they re going to build one of the biggest plants in the world maybe the biggest for that but percent we re going to charge them percent japan very very tough great people and again i don t blame the people for doing it it s i think they re very smart in doing it i blame the people that sat right in that oval office right over there right behind the resolute desk or whichever desk they chose japan percent they would charge us percent and much higher for certain items like cars you know little items like cars percent we re charging them percent india very very tough very very tough the prime minister just left and he s a great friend of mine but i said you re a friend of mine but you re not treating us right they charge us percent you have to understand we charge them almost nothing for years and years and decades and it was only seven years ago when i came in we started with china in charge and we took in hundreds of billions of dollars from china in tariffs and they understood honestly president xi understood he said look i understand and the other countries and they all understand we re going to have to go through a little tough love maybe but they all understand they re ripping us off and they understood it prime minister of japan shinzo was shinzo abe he was a fantastic man he was unfortunately taken from us assassination but i went to him and i said shinzo we have to do something trade is not fair he said i know that i know that and he was a great gentleman he was a fantastic man but he understood immediately what i was talking about i said shinzo we have to do something he said i know that and we worked out a deal and it would have been a much better deal but frankly there were many years left on the deal that was made previous to my getting there but it was something if you look at switzerland percent to percent indonesia malaysia cambodia oh look at cambodia percent we re going to bring it down to percent they made a fortune with the united states of america united kingdom percent and we ll go percent so we ll do the same thing south africa oh percent percent and they ve got some bad things going on in south africa you know we re paying them billions of dollars and we cut the funding because a lot of bad things are happening in south africa the fake news ought to be looking at it they don t want to report it brazil percent percent bangladesh is percent so you see what s going on pakistan percent sri lanka percent so what we re doing is we re taking not the full we could take the full percent thanks a lot he s doing a very good job how is he doing all right i think you better take it with you it s not going to last very long he s going to put it it s going to follow you down with the wind i brought a hat just in case it got too windy but here would anybody like a hat i m not giving it to a cabinet i m giving it to the auto workers come here thank you fellas get it that s it that s it they deserve it more than our cabinet laughter our cabinet has plenty of hats but you see the numbers the numbers are so disproportionate they re so unfair at the same time we will establish a minimum baseline tariff of percent you notice that on the chart and that ll be on other countries to help rebuild our economy and to prevent cheating so we re going to have a minimum of cheating and we re going to be very severe on the people that at the gate that watch the tariffs and watch the product coming in because there s been a lot of bad things happening at the gate because the money is so enormous that you re talking about there s never been probably anything like it in terms of the enormity and there are a lot of bad things happen at the people that do the check in and they re looking at year jail sentences if they do play we re going to treat them so good but if they cheat the repercussions are going to be extremely strong foreign nations will finally be asked to pay for the privilege of access to our market the biggest market in the world we re right now the biggest market in the world we had a great country four years ago in terms of the economics we were doubling up on china we were doing so well nobody was going to catch us but so much of it slipped away over the last four years under biden i campaigned on this policy throughout last year and today that promise was made and it was also a promise as you know that was kept promises made promises kept to any company that objects to our commonsense reciprocal tariffs again reciprocal back and forth back and forth and we i call this kind reciprocal this is not full reciprocal this is kind reciprocal but what we do is we cut it in half we charge them my answer is very simple if they complain if you want your tariff rate to be zero then you build your product right here in america because there is no tariff if you build your plant your product in america and we ve seen companies coming in like we ve never seen before likewise to all of the foreign presidents prime ministers kings queens ambassadors and everyone else who will soon be calling to ask for exemptions from these tariffs i say terminate your own tariffs drop your barriers don t manipulate your currencies they manipulate their currencies like nobody can even believe which is a bad bad thing and very devastating to us and start buying tens of billions of dollars of american goods tariffs give our country protection against those that would do us economic harm and many people were looking to do us economic harm maybe not so obviously but they were doing tremendous economic harm but even more importantly they will give us growth these tariffs are going to give us growth like you haven t seen before and it will be something very special to watch i am so looking forward and brian it s going to happen even faster than you said you know you might say but it s already started it s already started work s already begun on plants all around the country and you see that it s before these are big rich companies we have $ billion started on a big plant going up it s going to be announced over the next two days and they already started work many of these biggest the biggest companies in the world they ve committed to build build build we re going to build build build sir and they came here to see me and they came wanted to know if they could have a press conference i do as many as i can i m pretty busy trying to stop russia and ukraine and the middle east we ve got to stop that we ve got to stop the houthis which we re making tremendous they like shooting ships down and out of the water seeking ships they get a kick out of it but they re not getting such a kick out of it now are they mr secretary they re not getting such a kick out of that now but here s just a short list of some of the companies that have already announced and committed to investment and this is a company that built its factories and its plants in china apple is going to spend $ billion they never spent money like that here they re going to build their plants here softbank openai and oracle great great companies are investing $ billion almost immediately nvidia a hot company is investing hundreds of billions of dollars they just announced tsmc the biggest most important company in the world of chips from taiwan with no investment from us is investing $ billion and they said the reason was number one the election of november th and number two the tariffs they don t want to pay the tariffs and the way they re not paying it is to build their plant here so we re going to go from almost no percentage we used to have percent of the chip market now it s all in taiwan almost all of it s in taiwan a couple of other countries but mostly in taiwan and think of it we had percent we lost it because of people in that office that didn t do their job they allowed it to be stolen from us johnson johnson great company $ billion eli lilly $ billion meta is investing $ billion wow damac is investing $ billion cma cgm $ billion and then you have merck and clarios stellantis general motors ge aerospace honda nissan hyundai are all putting in billions and billions of dollars and they re committed percent and we ve never had and this is after two and a half months this is after just a short this all took place as soon as we came out with what everybody wanted to do i watched a gentleman today on television used to work with lee iacocca very respected automobile person and he said because they re asking people are they try and get as many negative people as they can but they can t find them too much it s pretty hard to find in terms of what we re doing especially when they see all this investment they said so tell me what do you think of what trump is doing from the automobile standpoint he said i can t believe it somebody is finally he s an older guy real pro really top guy with lee iacocca he said i never thought i d see the day when this would happen where somebody had the courage to go and do what has to be done this is transforming our nation our entire nation is going to be transformed not only with the cars but on every single other item that s built and we re going to become an industrial powerhouse and he said that so beautifully today in fact i m going to find out i m going to get a tape and bruce i m going to get that tape and i m going to send it to you out in long island and you re going to play it for the people and all your union workers and your nonunion workers out there you got a pretty even split but we have so far it looks like we re going to have about $ trillion of investments and you wouldn t do that in years in this country over the last number of years $ trillion and that s going to be much higher by the end of the year and think of what $ trillion is you wouldn t have even a small percentage of that under this other system we re going to be an entirely different country and it s going to be fantastic for the workers it s going to be fantastic for everyone there will never have been a transformation of a country like the transformation that s already happening in the united states of america it s an incredible thing to watch and it s incredible to meet with the top people people that you read about very wealthy people or people that are great managers and executives and presidents of big public companies and to watch the enthusiasm they have now that they didn t have they gave up on our country they went to foreign countries and they built companies are pouring into our country at levels never seen before with jobs and money to follow and it s really beautiful in the coming days there will be complaints from the globalists and the outsourcers and special interests and the fake news the fake news will always complain but never forget every prediction our opponents made about trade for the last years has been proven totally wrong they were wrong about nafta they were wrong about china they were wrong about the trans pacific partnership which would have been a disaster if i didn t terminate it if i didn t terminate that united auto workers you would have had no jobs in this country you would have had no jobs it was all going to other countries in my first term they said tariffs would crash the economy instead we built the greatest economy in the history of the world and again i have great respect for president xi of china great respect for china but they were taking tremendous advantage of us and i commend them for that i say hey if you can get away with it that s ok but they understand exactly what s happening and they probably most of them are saying it s about time they did something and they re going to fight and they re going to fight fair everyone s going to fight i say to the leaders look you got to take care of your country but we have to start taking care of our country now we can t do what we ve been doing for the last years from the day of my election the stock market went up in my first term percent with nasdaq going up percent more than any president has ever had in any term in office by far and i think we re going to blow that away and maybe the numbers won t show but i think they re going to show much better than even those numbers but what you re going to see is you re going to see activity that empty dead sites factories that are falling down those factories will be knocked down and they re going to have brand new factories built in their place and not only talking about renovating they re talking about brand new the best anywhere in the world the biggest anywhere in the world i have a friend who builds car plants and i said i want to see the biggest and the best he said well we have to go to mexico i said no i want to see it in the united states he said we re not building them in there this is a year and a half ago during the campaign he said we re not building you d have to go to mexico when i was starting to decide to run and i went to number one in the polls very rapidly i want to say i want to say like let s say in the first hour and then shortly thereafter it looked like i was going to win and the fake news was saying oh no don t do this what they don t know is if i didn t win they would have really been in trouble because nobody wants to read them anyway but i tell you what when it looked like i was going to win i announced that i was going to be doing exactly what we re talking about today great consistency actually because i ve been talking about it for years because i saw what was happening years ago if you look at my old speeches when i was young very handsome my old speeches and the people would say i d be on a television show i d be talking about how we were being ripped off by these countries i mean nothing changes very much the only thing that changed were the countries but nothing really changes but it s why it s such an honor it s such an honor to be finally able to do this if you look at china i took in hundreds of billions of dollars in my term hundreds of billions they never paid $ to any other president and yet they paid hundreds of billions so much so that biden couldn t do anything they wanted to try and terminate it because he had a very special relationship with china you know what the relationship was he had a special relationship but the numbers were so big the numbers were so big that they couldn t do it so they did ease it up they did things that they shouldn t have done they made it a lot more comfortable for them but they couldn t do it because the numbers were hundreds of billions of dollars and i did that and we were on our way to doing something like incredible and then we had a very bad election happened a very bad election a lot of bad things happened so when i said we got to do it again i said we have to make it too big to rig and we made it too big to rig and we won in records and it was a monumental win and it was such an honor to see so many of you like brian and your friends here with us to celebrate and to more importantly celebrate what we re doing because that wouldn t be a full celebration if we didn t do this because this would be an entirely different country in a short period of time it will be something the whole world will be talking about and the critics made the very tired predictions earlier this year but in february core inflation dropped to the lowest rate in four years and the price of eggs as you know just in a month and a half we were there for four weeks and the first week i got blamed for eggs i said i just got here they said eggs have gone up at like percent and you can t get eggs and they were going crazy and i said i just got here and then we got to work on eggs and we got to work on everything and our great secretary of agriculture you did a fantastic job brooke rollins she did a fantastic job and as i said before the price of eggs dropped now percent and they re going down more and the availability is fantastic they were saying that for easter please don t use eggs could you use plastic eggs i said we don t want to do that and you really came through it s an amazing job thank you very much brooke you did great but likewise an old fashioned term that we use groceries i used it on the campaign it s such an old fashioned term but a beautiful term groceries it sort of says a bag with different things in it groceries went through the roof and i campaigned on that i talked about the word groceries for a lot and energy costs now are down groceries are down gasoline is way under $ and people are beginning to to be able to buy things and live again we brought prices way down we created already in a few weeks new manufacturing jobs and that took place in one month numbers that they haven t seen in a long time we had virtually no inflation under my term we had virtually no inflation for four years but after transitioning over to sleepy joe it went from almost nonexistent to the highest in the history of our country they had the highest inflation in the history of our country brought up by energy and bad spending and bad policy and a lot of bad things happened how about allowing millions and millions and millions of people to pour into our country with open borders where the it s so sad to see even now and i see our great secretary you have done stand up please kristi stand up kristi noem and tom homan these people are doing a great job but uh gotten them out in records and we have problems with judges that don t want them to go out they want tren de aragua and they want ms the most vicious gangs ever nobody s ever seen anything like it absolute killer gangs they kill people they don t even think about it and we put them out and we have judges now radical left judges that they don t want them to go out they want them to even be brought back let s bring them back you ve done a fantastic job and please thank everybody homeland security thank everybody appreciate it and we now have a border that s the best border that we ve ever had even better than it was my first term my first term we did good but this one we really specialized in we ve done really well and we had records then with the best safest border four years ago we had the best border there ever was and now we have you ve actually matched it and done even better and we re going to get it down the right way and we want people by the way to come into our country but we want them to come in through a legal process we want them to come in legally we need more people we need people to run these plants and to help the auto workers and the teamsters and the nonunion people and everybody else but we need people and the farmers and we re going to let people come in but they want to come in we want them to come in legally they have to have the capability of loving our country not people that hate our country we don t want them in our country and now we re going to pass the largest tax cuts in american history and that s where we re relying on mike and john thune and we will not cut social security medicare or medicaid benefits and the democrats will because if they got in the entire economy would collapse this country was heading for a collapse under the people that you saw they were horrible i think one of the reasons people like the job i had my highest approval ratings because i think they re comparing me to the worst administration in the history of our country so i appreciate that at least but speaker of the house mike johnson and senate majority leader appreciate it mike john thune have been fantastic by the way but they ve been working tirelessly on taking the next step to pass the plan for our one big beautiful bill i d like to name it that if you can i made that statement about six months ago and everybody calls it one big beautiful bill and it will be that it will have everything the big tax cuts and every incentive there is and it will be a fantastic and by the way for the cars we re asking for an interest deduction on a loan so if you build the car only in america we do it brian if the car is not built in america you don t get the interest rate deduction but if you build the car in america if you buy a car if it s built in america then you get an interest rate deduction tax deduction and that s a big thing it s going to be a big thing i think that s going to pay for itself very quickly that deduction never happened we ve never had anything like that before somebody said where do you get the idea because it s so basic you would think that would have happened a long time ago it never did and i m very happy it didn t because now i can say that was my idea but we re going to get us closer to the debt extension we have to get the debt extension passed and i know you re going to be able to do that mike and it s very important that you do that and all of the other things that the senate budget plan gives us along with working because i know they re working together john and mike and the two bills are going very well together we need to get our shared priorities done including certain permanent tax cuts we want the tax cuts to be permanent spending cuts energy and historic investments in defense border and so much more we re covering everything these will be phenomenal there ll be no bill like this it s going to straighten one bill is going to straighten out our country for many many years to come and we said let s just do it and let s get it done and some guys will love it and some guys will like it a little bit less because they re not getting what they were exactly looking for but they re getting a lot if we get this done it will be the most incredible bill ever passed in the history of our congress and senate and congressman the senators and the congressmen many of whom are here today will be very proud of themselves i really believe that it s going to set us on a whole new prosperous path we re going to cut spending and right size the budget back to where it should be we re going to do that very strongly thank you rick thank you john thank you oh look look at all of our senators over there oh boy that s a nice group of people but i won t like them so much if they don t get this bill done that s a great group and congressman thank you very much i appreciate it tremendous people the senate plan is my complete and total support and the house plan likewise is very similar they re moving along pretty much at the same clip and as soon as you re ready you ll show it to me and i m sure it will have my support mike every republican congressman and senator must unify we have to unify we can t be separated we have to get it done we have to get absolutely everything we can and we have to take care of the american people that s the only thing that matters we have to take care of the american people first we need to pass this bill immediately get it done including debt extension from this day on we re not going to let anyone tell us that american workers and families cannot have the future that they deserve we re going to produce the cars and ships chips airplanes minerals and medicines that we need right here in america the pharmaceutical companies are going to come roaring back they re coming roaring back they re all coming back to our country because if they don t they ve got a big tax to pay and if they do i ll be very happy and you re going to be very happy and you re going to be very safe we re going to build our future with american hands with american heart american steel and we re going to build it with american pride like we used to we re approaching our th day as president and have been given credit by a lot of people actually even some of the fake news can you believe it which in this case hopefully isn t fake for having done more in that time than any other administration in the history of our country in the first days i think we ve had an amazing in terms of what we ve done what we ve gotten accomplished i d like to see if we can get that war ended and another war from not starting in the middle east we have to get russia they re losing on average people a day young people soldiers russians think of that through some days but on average probably over about a one week period it s they say they re losing those soldiers they re dying they re being decimated and they re not from our country but they re from other countries but they re human beings they re from russia they re from ukraine in this period most of them and we re going to get it stopped it s a senseless war that would have never happened if i was president and it shouldn t be allowed to go on and i think we re being given good cooperation by russia and by ukraine but we have to get it stopped it s humanity it s humanity it s a terrible thing this will be a very big moment i think you re going to remember today it s going to be a free nation that we re dealing with we re going to have a very free and beautiful nation it s going to be liberation day in america and it s going to be a day that hopefully you re going to look back in years to come and you re going to say he was right this has turned out to be one of the most important days in the history of our country god bless you and god bless america thank you everybody thank you very much thank you thank you very much thank you this is will everybody he s going to just give you a little bit he s going to give you a little bit of a briefing on what we re

/Users/samantha/Desktop/speech text data/rollcall.csv,"Hello, everybody.
How you doing?
Hi, sir.
So I think most of you have seen, they released my physical. They did took the physical on Friday, and I understand it was a very good report. The numbers were perfect. And I took a cognitive exam and I would challenge anybody here to meet those marks because I have a perfect mark. Were you impressed by that?
I am impressed and I'm not gonna take that test.
But you're not that surprised, right?
[Laughs] I'm not surprised at all.
Uh, you aren't. That's good. 'Cause I, I'm not in respect for you as a reporter. Uh, did you have any questions?
Yes, sir. Could give us a --
You always have.
I always have question. What is your message to markets tomorrow? There's some ambiguity or at least some, some questions about whether there were exceptions or exceptions --
Well, there shouldn't be. There shouldn't be ambiguity. Uh, we have a tremendous country. We have a country that's much richer today than it was a few months ago. We have a financial system that's very respected and, uh, we're gonna do great. And we were taken advantage of and ripped off by every country all over the world, almost, just about.
They laughed at us and we were run by foolish people and they took advantage of our country and we're just not gonna let that happen anymore.
In terms of the, uh --
Who else?
-- the big beautiful bill --
Right.
-- when do you expect that to get done? What would want --
Well, I hope soon the big beautiful bill and it's, uh, the big beautiful tax cuts really, and regulation cuts and many other things. Uh, it passed its first test, as you know, the, the last couple of weeks, but particularly during last week where we had a vote. We won in the house, we won in the senate and, uh, that was a big chunk of it. And now they're gonna eventually take, pretty soon, a final vote.
And the big beautiful tax cuts and regulation cuts and all of the other things that are included in there will go into effect. And I think it'll be probably the largest tax cuts in the history of our country, the most comprehensive regulation cuts in the history of our country and many, many other things, including border wall money.
Uh, we built 571 miles of wall, but now we can add to it. Uh, as you know, we, we've just concluded a period of time where the border was the most secure it's been in the history of our country. We're very proud of the, the, the other week, couple of weeks ago, or last week actually, five people came in, five, and under Biden it was 500,000 people came in. What they've done to our country should never be forgotten, never be forgotten what they've done and that the news hasn't reported it correctly is a disgrace.
But what they've done to our country to allow these millions and millions of people in from prisons and mental institutions, insane asylums should never be forgotten. [Inaudible] we're gonna be living with that for a long time. This is tremendous work, tremendous effort. It's one thing they caused massive inflation, they caused a lot of problems, but what they've done to our border, to our country, you should never forget that.
And you should never, as journalists, allow people to forget it. Yeah?
Mr. President, can you talk a little bit about the semiconductor tariff --
Yeah.
-- that you posted on Truth Social today? What is the timeline for that? And I believe it was Jamieson Greer said today that those will not be negotiable.
Well --
Once those tariffs are in place, they are non-negotiable. Is that right?
That's right. But the tariffs will be in place, uh, in the not distant future because, as you know, like we did with steel, like we did with automobiles, like we did with aluminum, which are now fully on, we'll be doing that with semiconductors, with, uh, chips and numerous other things. And, uh, that'll take place in the very near future.
And, and all the things --
And what we did is we wanna uncomplicate it from a lot of companies because that's really where it should be, ideally. And we wanted to uncomplicate it from a lot of other companies 'cause we wanna make our chips and semiconductors and other things in our country. And I will tell you, another one is pharmaceuticals, drugs and pharmaceuticals.
We wanna make our drugs in this country and by, uh, placing a tariff on the companies that are not in this country, they're gonna move into our country and we're gonna have our drugs made in the United States. So that in case of war, in case of whatever, we're not relying on China and various other countries to supply us with drugs, which is not a good idea.
And it'll happen very fast. It'll all happen very fast. Yeah?
Do you know [Inaudible] read the, the semiconductor tariff --
I, I'm gonna be announcing it over the next week.
Can you confirm reports that the Social Security Administration has classified thousands of immigrants as dead even though they're still all living?
That's what I hear. I mean, that's what has been reported to me. Uh, dead and, uh, also very inaccurately. And from the standpoint of Social Security, it's a horrible thing. From the standpoint of the, uh, strength of Social Security, when you take dead people out and all of the people that they're talking about, uh, that should not be in there, it's gonna make our system much stronger.
We're making Social Security stronger. The Democrats are destroying Social Security. Medicare and Medicaid also.
Yeah, so do you have a reaction to Russia's Palm Sunday attack on Ukraine?
Oh, I think it was terrible, and I was told they made a mistake. Uh, but I think it's a horrible thing. I think the whole war's a horrible thing. I think the war is -- For that war to have started is an abuse of power. This country would've never allowed that war to have started if I were president. That war is a shame.
Millions of people are dead that should be alive. Cities are being destroyed all over Ukraine. The whole culture is gone. It's -- Or very, certainly very severely hurt. You know, the, uh, the chapels, the churches, the, uh, spirals, all of the things that they had in Ukraine were among the most beautiful anywhere in the world.
And most have been knocked down and blown up into a million pieces. But most importantly, you have millions of people dead that shouldn't be dead. Think of it. Think of what a rigged election means. We would've had absolutely -- We wouldn't have had the war in Ukraine. We wouldn't have had the Russia Ukraine situation.
We wouldn't have had October 7th, Israel, the Middle East. We wouldn't have inflation. We wouldn't have had the most embarrassing day or a period in the history of our country. That's Afghanistan. One of the most embarrassing moments in the history of our country, in Afghanistan. All of these things wouldn't have taken place.
Think of it, we wouldn't have had inflation. But millions of people would be alive except for the fact that the election were rigged because that war would've never started and Putin never would've started that war. Okay, any other question?
[Crosstalk] Would you say they made a mistake in the attack? You said they made a m- -- you t- -- were told they made a mistake.
They, they made --
Do you mean it was unintentional?
They made a mistake. I believe it was -- Look, you're gonna ask them. This is Biden's war. This is not my war. I've been here for a very short period of time. This is a war that was under Biden. He gave them billions and billions of dollars. He should have, uh, never allowed. If he w- -- if he had any brain, which he didn't have and doesn't have, and now it's been proven, uh, he wouldn't have allowed that water to start.
I would've absolutely not -- That war would never have taken place. But remember this. This is Biden's war. I'm just trying to get it stopped so that we can save a lot of lives. They happen to be Ukrainian and Russian lives, but all I wanna do is get it stopped.
Witkoff [Inaudible] Sir, did you meet with Mr. Witkoff today? How did --
I did. I met with him and he had some very good meetings in the Middle East, and he also had good meetings having to do with Russia, Ukraine.
[Crosstalk]
[Inaudible] update on Iran?
Well, we're gonna be doing it very shortly. Iran also, uh, it was another, where I met with a different group of people in Iran, and we'll be making a decision on Iran very quickly. Yeah, please?
[Crosstalk]
Uh, back on Russia, Ukraine. Resolving that war has taken a little longer than you predicted. Uh, can you pinpoint --
Well, it's deeply --
-- the reasons why?
-- it's a deeply seated war. And again, it's a war that people didn't expect would start. And in my, in my administration, there was no chance that it would start. And it didn't, by the way. You know, I went four years and it didn't start. People say, ""Oh, well how do you know?"" Well, I know because I went four years and it didn't start.
You would've never had that war. It would've never started. Putin never would've start -- started it. I mean, I think frankly he had so little respect for Biden, that he started it for that reason, and obviously he didn't get along very well with, uh, Zelensky or anybody else. And, uh, now you have millions of dead people.
And those people, every one of them, should be alive right now.
[Crosstalk]
Mr. President, are you going to announce tariffs on things like iPhones, tablets?
Well, that's gonna be announced very soon and we'll, uh, we'll be discussing it, but we'll also talk to companies. You know, uh, you have to show a certain flexibility. Nobody should be so rigid. We will -- You have to have a certain flexibility and we're doing really well. And, uh, financially our country's gonna be stronger than it's ever been.
So some products might -- There's flexibility for some products?
For some products, yeah. Maybe.
Can you say what time products?
Now, I'll be announcing it in the not too distant future, but it's gonna be separately announced.
[Crosstalk]
Mr. President, do you have any reaction to, uh --
I'd very much like if you, look, automobiles, again, automobiles, we have a tariff. Nobody's complaining about it. It went through the process, we have the tariff. Uh, steel, aluminum and some other things, so -- And by the way, our country is taking in billions and billions of dollars on those tariffs. Billions of dollars.
And maybe, almost as importantly, or maybe more importantly, automobile companies, steel companies, steel companies and factories, and aluminum companies and factories are opening up in our country. But we're taking in billions of dollars on just those three categories.
Speaking of steel, can you talk about your conversations with Nippon Steel and what --
Yeah, we're talking about different things, but we think that, I think that, the United States Steel, uh, one of the great companies of the world, U- -- U.S. Steel, should, uh, remain in our country. I feel that, I felt that for a long time this was one of the greatest company, companies in the world. For a period of time, for a long period of time, it was the single greatest company in America and I just don't think a foreign company should control it.
[Crosstalk]
And you know what? They're not gonna have to, because the tariffs are gonna make U.S. Steel do so well.
I heard a report, uh, at your NRCC dinner that I was at. A guy was at my table. He said that Mexico has been dumping raw sewage in our treatment water.
Yeah.
We can't keep up with it. Some of it's spilling in the ocean, forcing, uh --
It's true.
-- Navy SEALs -- to train north of Coronado Island.
That's right.
Any --
Well, and it floats up --
And it floats up --
-- past Los Angeles --
Yeah.
-- like everything else.
Yeah. Any, any, uh --
Yeah.
-- talks of --
Yeah.
-- of trying to --
-- Mexico has a faulty sewage system that's dumping, uh, sewage into our part of the ocean.
Yeah.
And, uh, the Pacific Ocean's not looking too good on many occasions. Sometimes it stops and sometimes it breaks. And when it breaks, uh, very bad and disgusting things happen, and they shouldn't be doing that.
So exactly when -- Mr. President -- [Inaudible]
-- any reaction to the Governor of Pennsylvania, his mansion set on fire. Do you have any reaction to it?
I just heard about it. No, I'll have to look into it.
You got the perfect health report. All of our -- all, all, everybody in the press wants to know this. How do you do it, Mr. President? I haven't sat up till 2:00 AM in the morning since I was 25, and now we're 2:16 in the morning having a press conference. How do you do it?
Oh, we had a couple of them at two o'clock in the morning now. Biden, I guarantee --
You're wearing the press out.
Biden was sleeping for 10 hours already. Uh, no, I have a lot of respect for the press, really I do. Some of it's fake news, but a lot of it's good, like you. And, uh, really some of it's totally fake and sound like 60 Minute and I don't wanna --
But how do you stay so healthy? How do you stay so --
Um --
-- energized?
Um, because I enjoy what I'm doing and I like the results. I think, uh, I think we're making America great again, and it makes me feel good.
And it feels --
And it probably keeps me happy.
Yeah. There --
Okay.
Yeah.
Thank you. That's a nice question. Give me -- that's a -- I like this guy.
[Laughs] Well, I mean, everyone's wondering --
Thank you.
-- how in the world do you do it, Mr. President? Two --

Did you catch, catch the end of The Masters?
Oh --
Ooh.

Have you [Inaudible]
Actually, it's better for him than it happened that way 'cause it --
Yeah.
-- showed real courage. To have come back from what could have been a tragedy was amazing. Did you watch it?
Yeah -- yeah -- we did. We were in the press van.
Pretty amazing, right?
We knew when you were pulling out when it was over.
Oh no, I wasn't going to watch it.
You were going nowhere.
You knew there was no way. Even for you people there was no way.
I mean, that was a -- have you spoken [Inaudible]
It's one of my favorite shows ever. The Masters is, to me, my, maybe my favorite sporting show. And, uh, it showed, and you know, Justin Rose was great. They all --
Yeah.
Look, they're, they're, uh, great athletes under tremendous pressure. But unless you're a golfer, you don't understand it. It's a hundredth of an inch makes a difference between a great shot and a horrible shot. Think of it. Just a little tiny, a little small percentage of an inch and literally in some cases a hundredth of an inch --
Right. Sean --
-- is the difference between winning and losing.
Sean's telling --
Pretty amazing.

[Laughs]
I can take it.
We don't want that but they're amazing. Dana White's amazing. Have a good time everybody.
You too sir. Thank you. Appreciate it.",12,hello everybody how you doing hi sir so i think most of you have seen they released my physical they did took the physical on friday and i understand it was a very good report the numbers were perfect and i took a cognitive exam and i would challenge anybody here to meet those marks because i have a perfect mark were you impressed by that i am impressed and i m not gonna take that test but you re not that surprised right laughs i m not surprised at all uh you aren t that s good cause i i m not in respect for you as a reporter uh did you have any questions yes sir could give us a you always have i always have question what is your message to markets tomorrow there s some ambiguity or at least some some questions about whether there were exceptions or exceptions well there shouldn t be there shouldn t be ambiguity uh we have a tremendous country we have a country that s much richer today than it was a few months ago we have a financial system that s very respected and uh we re gonna do great and we were taken advantage of and ripped off by every country all over the world almost just about they laughed at us and we were run by foolish people and they took advantage of our country and we re just not gonna let that happen anymore in terms of the uh who else the big beautiful bill right when do you expect that to get done what would want well i hope soon the big beautiful bill and it s uh the big beautiful tax cuts really and regulation cuts and many other things uh it passed its first test as you know the the last couple of weeks but particularly during last week where we had a vote we won in the house we won in the senate and uh that was a big chunk of it and now they re gonna eventually take pretty soon a final vote and the big beautiful tax cuts and regulation cuts and all of the other things that are included in there will go into effect and i think it ll be probably the largest tax cuts in the history of our country the most comprehensive regulation cuts in the history of our country and many many other things including border wall money uh we built miles of wall but now we can add to it uh as you know we we ve just concluded a period of time where the border was the most secure it s been in the history of our country we re very proud of the the the other week couple of weeks ago or last week actually five people came in five and under biden it was people came in what they ve done to our country should never be forgotten never be forgotten what they ve done and that the news hasn t reported it correctly is a disgrace but what they ve done to our country to allow these millions and millions of people in from prisons and mental institutions insane asylums should never be forgotten inaudible we re gonna be living with that for a long time this is tremendous work tremendous effort it s one thing they caused massive inflation they caused a lot of problems but what they ve done to our border to our country you should never forget that and you should never as journalists allow people to forget it yeah mr president can you talk a little bit about the semiconductor tariff yeah that you posted on truth social today what is the timeline for that and i believe it was jamieson greer said today that those will not be negotiable well once those tariffs are in place they are non negotiable is that right that s right but the tariffs will be in place uh in the not distant future because as you know like we did with steel like we did with automobiles like we did with aluminum which are now fully on we ll be doing that with semiconductors with uh chips and numerous other things and uh that ll take place in the very near future and and all the things and what we did is we wanna uncomplicate it from a lot of companies because that s really where it should be ideally and we wanted to uncomplicate it from a lot of other companies cause we wanna make our chips and semiconductors and other things in our country and i will tell you another one is pharmaceuticals drugs and pharmaceuticals we wanna make our drugs in this country and by uh placing a tariff on the companies that are not in this country they re gonna move into our country and we re gonna have our drugs made in the united states so that in case of war in case of whatever we re not relying on china and various other countries to supply us with drugs which is not a good idea and it ll happen very fast it ll all happen very fast yeah do you know inaudible read the the semiconductor tariff i i m gonna be announcing it over the next week can you confirm reports that the social security administration has classified thousands of immigrants as dead even though they re still all living that s what i hear i mean that s what has been reported to me uh dead and uh also very inaccurately and from the standpoint of social security it s a horrible thing from the standpoint of the uh strength of social security when you take dead people out and all of the people that they re talking about uh that should not be in there it s gonna make our system much stronger we re making social security stronger the democrats are destroying social security medicare and medicaid also yeah so do you have a reaction to russia s palm sunday attack on ukraine oh i think it was terrible and i was told they made a mistake uh but i think it s a horrible thing i think the whole war s a horrible thing i think the war is for that war to have started is an abuse of power this country would ve never allowed that war to have started if i were president that war is a shame millions of people are dead that should be alive cities are being destroyed all over ukraine the whole culture is gone it s or very certainly very severely hurt you know the uh the chapels the churches the uh spirals all of the things that they had in ukraine were among the most beautiful anywhere in the world and most have been knocked down and blown up into a million pieces but most importantly you have millions of people dead that shouldn t be dead think of it think of what a rigged election means we would ve had absolutely we wouldn t have had the war in ukraine we wouldn t have had the russia ukraine situation we wouldn t have had october th israel the middle east we wouldn t have inflation we wouldn t have had the most embarrassing day or a period in the history of our country that s afghanistan one of the most embarrassing moments in the history of our country in afghanistan all of these things wouldn t have taken place think of it we wouldn t have had inflation but millions of people would be alive except for the fact that the election were rigged because that war would ve never started and putin never would ve started that war okay any other question crosstalk would you say they made a mistake in the attack you said they made a m you t were told they made a mistake they they made do you mean it was unintentional they made a mistake i believe it was look you re gonna ask them this is biden s war this is not my war i ve been here for a very short period of time this is a war that was under biden he gave them billions and billions of dollars he should have uh never allowed if he w if he had any brain which he didn t have and doesn t have and now it s been proven uh he wouldn t have allowed that water to start i would ve absolutely not that war would never have taken place but remember this this is biden s war i m just trying to get it stopped so that we can save a lot of lives they happen to be ukrainian and russian lives but all i wanna do is get it stopped witkoff inaudible sir did you meet with mr witkoff today how did i did i met with him and he had some very good meetings in the middle east and he also had good meetings having to do with russia ukraine crosstalk inaudible update on iran well we re gonna be doing it very shortly iran also uh it was another where i met with a different group of people in iran and we ll be making a decision on iran very quickly yeah please crosstalk uh back on russia ukraine resolving that war has taken a little longer than you predicted uh can you pinpoint well it s deeply the reasons why it s a deeply seated war and again it s a war that people didn t expect would start and in my in my administration there was no chance that it would start and it didn t by the way you know i went four years and it didn t start people say oh well how do you know well i know because i went four years and it didn t start you would ve never had that war it would ve never started putin never would ve start started it i mean i think frankly he had so little respect for biden that he started it for that reason and obviously he didn t get along very well with uh zelensky or anybody else and uh now you have millions of dead people and those people every one of them should be alive right now crosstalk mr president are you going to announce tariffs on things like iphones tablets well that s gonna be announced very soon and we ll uh we ll be discussing it but we ll also talk to companies you know uh you have to show a certain flexibility nobody should be so rigid we will you have to have a certain flexibility and we re doing really well and uh financially our country s gonna be stronger than it s ever been so some products might there s flexibility for some products for some products yeah maybe can you say what time products now i ll be announcing it in the not too distant future but it s gonna be separately announced crosstalk mr president do you have any reaction to uh i d very much like if you look automobiles again automobiles we have a tariff nobody s complaining about it it went through the process we have the tariff uh steel aluminum and some other things so and by the way our country is taking in billions and billions of dollars on those tariffs billions of dollars and maybe almost as importantly or maybe more importantly automobile companies steel companies steel companies and factories and aluminum companies and factories are opening up in our country but we re taking in billions of dollars on just those three categories speaking of steel can you talk about your conversations with nippon steel and what yeah we re talking about different things but we think that i think that the united states steel uh one of the great companies of the world u u s steel should uh remain in our country i feel that i felt that for a long time this was one of the greatest company companies in the world for a period of time for a long period of time it was the single greatest company in america and i just don t think a foreign company should control it crosstalk and you know what they re not gonna have to because the tariffs are gonna make u s steel do so well i heard a report uh at your nrcc dinner that i was at a guy was at my table he said that mexico has been dumping raw sewage in our treatment water yeah we can t keep up with it some of it s spilling in the ocean forcing uh it s true navy seals to train north of coronado island that s right any well and it floats up and it floats up past los angeles yeah like everything else yeah any any uh yeah talks of yeah of trying to mexico has a faulty sewage system that s dumping uh sewage into our part of the ocean yeah and uh the pacific ocean s not looking too good on many occasions sometimes it stops and sometimes it breaks and when it breaks uh very bad and disgusting things happen and they shouldn t be doing that so exactly when mr president inaudible any reaction to the governor of pennsylvania his mansion set on fire do you have any reaction to it i just heard about it no i ll have to look into it you got the perfect health report all of our all all everybody in the press wants to know this how do you do it mr president i haven t sat up till am in the morning since i was and now we re in the morning having a press conference how do you do it oh we had a couple of them at two o clock in the morning now biden i guarantee you re wearing the press out biden was sleeping for hours already uh no i have a lot of respect for the press really i do some of it s fake news but a lot of it s good like you and uh really some of it s totally fake and sound like minute and i don t wanna but how do you stay so healthy how do you stay so um energized um because i enjoy what i m doing and i like the results i think uh i think we re making america great again and it makes me feel good and it feels and it probably keeps me happy yeah there okay yeah thank you that s a nice question give me that s a i like this guy laughs well i mean everyone s wondering thank you how in the world do you do it mr president two i don t know two o clock in the morning i m years old and i can t keep up with you what a nice age that is have have a good time everybody did you catch catch the end of the masters oh ooh i did well i have to congratulate rory

And they had me set — I wanted to go to Los Angeles and see what was going on with California, why they aren’t releasing the water.  Millions and millions of gallons of water, they’re sending it out to the Pacific.  Someday, somebody’s going — going to explain that one.  In the meantime, they have no water in Los Angeles, where they had the problems. But — so, we’re going there.  But I said, “Well, what about North Carolina?”  “Well, you could do that la-” — “no, I can’t.”  I said, “We’re stopping in North Carolina first, and then we’re going to Los Angeles.” And we just appreciate the outpouring of love that we’ve had here.  Lara was, as you know, very instrumental in the campaign, and she lived here and is loved, and we appreciate it.  And Michael Whatley has been incredible — wherever Michael is — hello, Michael.  Michael Whatley has been great.  And your congressmen have been great.  And what we thought we’d do is take a quick look around.  First, we wanted to do this.  I — I want to say that we’re very disappointed in FEMA.  Your new governor, it’s not his fault.  He’s brand-new to the whole situation.  But we’re going to work together with the governor.  We’re going to work together with the — your senators, but, really, we’re going to work a lot with your congressman, especially the three that are in the area, and Michael Whatley.  And I’d like to put Michael in charge of making sure everything goes well.  And Franklin Graham has been unbelievable.  We’ve made a big contribution to Franklin, and we’ll continue to do so.  But I — I’ve been hearing nothing but praise for the job that Samaritan’s Purse has done with Franklin, and we appreciate it.  Where is Franklin?  He’s around here someplace.  (Laughter.)  And — that good-looking guy.  He’s always been a good-looking guy.  His father was a good-looking guy, too, I’ll tell you.  We loved his father, right?  I saw his father in the latter years, and I said, “Well, he — he doesn’t have long to go.”  He was having a hard time, and he lived about three, four years after that, right?  REVEREND GRAHAM:  That’s right. THE PRESIDENT:  He — he was — they call — they say he was “good stock.”  He had the ultimate good stock.  But I want to thank you, Franklin.  You were — you’ve been fantastic here.  And everywhere he goes, he — he’s always — he’s always the first one I see.  Does — people don’t realize it, how — how good it is.  A lot of people, they go, “Well, maybe it’s for the people that he’s got.”  And you guys know, because you’re here, but the people that he’s got have done amazing work.  So, I just want to thank everybody.  We’re going to get over and take a look.  We’ll say a few words.  I want to just — I do want to introduce some of the people that we have.  And our first lady — we’ll start with our first lady.  She wanted to be here because of North Carolina.  And then I said, “Well, you can do that, but you’re going to have to come to California too.”  (Laughter.)  THE FIRST LADY:  That’s okay. THE PRESIDENT:  And she said, “That’s okay.”  (Laughter.) And we got to fix that one up too.  That’s — who — do you ever see anything like that one?  It’s — who would have — who would have thought that could have happened.  So, Governor Josh Stein, thank you very much.  We appreciate it.  And we’re going to have a — a very long and good relationship.  Representatives — maybe stand up, if you would, so we — the press can see.  Representatives Chuck Edwards — Chuck, thank you.  Thank you, Chuck.  Tim Moore.  Virginia.  You know Virginia Foxx, a legend — she is such a powerful woman.  Pat Harrigan.  Pat, thank you very much.  Your agriculture commissioner, who I hear is excellent, Steve Troxler — Steve, thank you very much.  Good job, Steve.  You’ve got plenty to do, right? MR. TROXLER:  (Inaudible.) THE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  More than you ever thought.  North Carolina Speaker Destin Hall.  Thank you, Destin.  Thanks, Destin.  Very good.  House Majority Leader Brenden Jones.  Brenden, thank you very much.  We’re making progress, Brenden.  State Representatives Dudley Greene, Karl Gillespie, thank you very much, fellas.  Good, good.  Thank you very much.  State Senators Kevin Corbin, Warren Daniel, thank you.  Thank you very much, Kevin, Warren.  And County Commissioner Jennifer Best, thank you.  Jennifer, thank you. So, Hurricane Helene was one of the worst natural disasters in American history.  It was far worse than it was even billed.  I have never seen such water damage.  It was largely water damage — wind damage, but water damage nobody has ever seen.  I’ve been here, as you know, numerous times, but now I’m here in a position where we can do something, meaning I’ve been in — in office for four days.  And I wanted to come sooner, but actually, they had a little problem with getting, logistically, in here, but I would have been ev- — here even sooner. One oh four — a hundred and four North Carolinians have — at least — have lost their lives.  Is that now a fairly firm number, or are they still finding people?  You know?  Is — what do you think?  They’re still finding people?  Pretty much, okay?  It’s a lot of people.  A hundred and four people lost their lives.  Seventy-three thousand homes were severely damaged or destroyed.  And I’ll tell you, I’ve been to a lot of them, and this was a — this was like lots of hurricanes in one.  I’ve never seen such damage done by water.  And the — the water came, it was violent, and it left, and there was, like, nothing left.  It’s really pretty amazing.  At one point, half of the emergency calls to FEMA went unanswered.  That’s real bad.  FEMA was not doing their job.  The city of Asheville went without running water for two months.  A whistleblower testified that some FEMA employees refused to help people who displayed Trump signs on their properties.  I think that’s true, isn’t it?  I read that.  That’s not nice.  That’s not too nice, is it? But whoever those property people were, thank you very much.  Michael, is that true? MR. WHATLEY:  (Inaudible.) THE PRESIDENT:  That’s not good — huh? — about the property owners.  You put a Trump sign on it, they wouldn’t help — FEMA.  Earlier this year, FEMA kicked 2,000 North Carolinians out of their temporary housing into below-freezing temperatures.  What was that all about?  Is that — do you know about that?  What happened?  Tell me. STATE SPEAKER HALL:  We had an incompetent administration under Biden.  And we had a disaster, and then we call it “the disaster after the disaster” — that was the FEMA response. THE PRESIDENT:  You had nothing but disaster since then.  I — it doesn’t matter at this point.  Biden did a bad job.  Some residents still don’t have hot water, drinking water, or anything else.  And m- — many of them don’t have quarters.  They don’t have anything.  They got a stipend for what they lost, and we’re going to take care of it.  This is totally unacceptable, and I’ll be taking strong action to get North Carolina the support that you need to quickly recover and rebuild.  We’re working on it very hard. And I think if Michael Whatley does half as good a job for North Carolina as he did for my campaign, we’ll be very happy.  (Laughter.)  Him and Lara were a very powerful team.  So, you think you can handle it, Michael?  I don’t know.  I’m not sure, Michael.  (Laughter.)  I think this is maybe, in many ways, easier.  Okay?  Maybe easier.  But you’re going to lead the team.  Do you want to say who the — who the congressmen are that you want to appoint?  Do you want to introduce them? MR. WHATLEY:  So, we — we have Virginia Foxx and Chuck Edwards and Tim Moore — THE PRESIDENT:  And — MR. WHATLEY:  — whose districts encompass the area (inaudible) — THE PRESIDENT:  And they are the districts that were most severely impacted, right?  You were — you were affected, then, Virginia? REPRESENTATIVE FOXX:  Yes, sir.  Lost my own property. THE PRESIDENT:  Really?  Well, I’ll also be signing an executive order to begin the process of fundamentally reforming and overhauling FEMA or maybe getting rid of FEMA.  I think, frankly, FEMA is not good.  I think when you have a problem like this, I think you want to go and — whether it’s a Democrat or a Republican governor, you want to use your state to fix it and not waste time calling FEMA.  And then FEMA gets here, and they don’t know the area, they’ve never been to the area, and they want to give you rules that you’ve never heard about, they want to bring people that aren’t as good as the people you already have.  And FEMA has turned out to be a — a disaster.  And you could go back a long way.  You could go back to Louisiana.  You could go back to some of the things that took place in Texas.  It — it turns out to be the state that ends up doing the work.  It just complicates it.  I think we’re going to recommend that FEMA go away and we pay directly — we pay a percentage to the state.  But the state should fix this.  If the state did this from the beginning, it would have been a lot better situation.  I think you guys agree with that, right? So, I just want to tell that Ash- — say that Asheville — I know it well.  It’s a great place, and we’re going to have it be a great place again.  That was the one that was most severely affected.  But North Carolina is going to come back bigger, better, stronger than ever before, and you’re going to be very thankful.  And you’ve already seen — I know that it really began four days ago, but you’ve already seen more action than you have in the last three months.  And we’re going to get it together.  We’re informing the Army Corps of Engineers to get going, because you have a lot of river breaks and a lot of areas that you’re going to need some pretty big work.  And they’re on their way.  They’re going to be working very — much harder than they’ve been working in the past.  And we’re going to take care of it.  Any questions from the press of any of the congressmen, governor, anybody? Q    Sir, are you going to sign an executive order on FEMA — getting rid of it?  Can you explain more about signing the executive order to get rid of FEMA, please? THE PRESIDENT:  FEMA has been a very big disappointment.  They cost a tremendous amount of money.  It’s very bureaucratic, and it’s very slow.  Other than that, we’re very happy with them.  Okay?  (Laughter.) And I think it’s — I think when there’s a — when there’s a problem with the state, I think that that problem should be taken care of by the state.  That’s what we have states for; they take care of problems.  And a governor can handle something very quickly. You know, one of the things I’ve noticed, because I’ve been doing this for a while, and we had a pretty good FEMA.  But I also noticed that when they come, they end up in arguments of — they’re fighting all the time over who does what.  It’s a — just a — it’s just not a good system. This system is so beautifully designed over 250 years, approximately, you know, and we’ll soon be celebrating the 250th year.  It’s going to be a very big celebration.  But it’s been designed very well, and we’re going to leave it that way. When North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Tennessee, when — everybody knows the governor of Tennessee, I think — everybody.  Do you — do you know everybody here, pretty much?  He’s o- — GOVERNOR LEE:  I — I’ve introduced myself.   THE PRESIDENT:  I never thought of it, but you’re right over the ridge, right? GOVERNOR LEE:  Right over the hi- — right over the hillside. THE PRESIDENT:  So — so, you’re here to help.  That’s great. GOVERNOR LEE:  These here, thi- — the people in this region, including Tennessee — the people of Appalachia are grateful that you are here and that you haven’t forgotten them.  THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah. GOVERNOR LEE:  And that there are other disasters, but this one was enormous for both North Carolina and Tennessee.  So, thank you. THE PRESIDENT:  You know, I’ve seen a lot of disasters, and this — when I came — I came here right after, the day after.  And when I came here, I couldn’t believe it, actually.  I couldn’t believe the damage.  I — and I’ve seen a lot of them.  This was — this was more like a tornado than it was — what we witnessed.  So, we’re going to get it very much — very much taken care of.  Good job.  That’s nice that you came. GOVERNOR LEE:  Thank you, sir. THE PRESIDENT:  And so, you call it right — you’re right over the ridge, right?  Tennessee. GOVERNOR LEE:  Right over the ridge, yes, sir. THE PRESIDENT:  I like Tennessee, too.  Let’s see.  Where did I get more votes — Tennessee or North Carolina?  I hate — (laughter) — I hate to tell you, North Carolina, it was Tennessee.  GOVERNOR LEE:  There’s one of the counties in this disaster that had 88 percent for you.  So (inaudible) — THE PRESIDENT:  Eighty-eight percent, yeah?  That’s — the people are just incredible people. GOVERNOR LEE:  Yeah. THE PRESIDENT:  So, do you have any questions, press? Q    Yes, Mr. President, you talked about conditions being placed on aid to California — voter ID and the like.  Are there any conditions that you’re going to put on aid to North Carolina? THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, we’re going to do a lot for North Carolina.  You know, they’ve been very slow.  I don’t know why it’s been so bad.  This has been one of the worst I’ve seen.  Katrina, of course, you know, was somebo- — something that — obviously, that was a long time ago — that was not good.  But this has been very slow.  I don’t know if that was for political reasons because they lost the state.  You know, Biden lost the state.  Maybe he felt — he doesn’t care.  Maybe there were other reasons.  I don’t know. But this has been very slow.  By any standard, this has been very slow.  And we’re going to — we’re going to make up for lost time. Q    But no conditions you’re going to push for aid, just full stop? THE PRESIDENT:  Well, in California, I have a condition.  In California, we want them to have voter ID so the people have a voice, because right now, the people don’t have a voice because you don’t know who’s voting and it’s very corrupt.  And we also want them to release the water.  If they release the water, they wouldn’t have had a problem.  If they released the water when I told them to — because I told them to do it seven years ago — if they would have done it, you wouldn’t have had the problem that you had.  You might have — you might not have even had a fire. So — but here, I don’t have that.  It’s a different thing.  You got hit by a storm.  The people are incredible.  They worked really well.  Franklin was fantastic, and other groups — by the way, other groups came in that were also fantastic.  And other states came in; Tennessee and a couple of others came in, and they really helped.  That’s the way it’s supposed to be. No, this is a different kind of a thing. Q    Mr. President, have you decided how much funding you would allocate for disaster relief in North Carolina? THE PRESIDENT:  About what? Q    Have you decided how much funding you would allocate for disaster relief? THE PRESIDENT:  I haven’t de- — I have to see what it is. Q    Mr. President — Q    Are — are — are you disappointed that Senator Schiff hasn’t joined you on this trip?  It’s reported that you invited Senator Schiff to join you on this trip, and he was too busy.  Are you disappointed by that? THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know, I — I was told that Schiff was going to travel with us to California.  I wasn’t thrilled, to be honest with you.  (Laughter.)  And I saw him last night on television.  It looks like he got hit with a baseball bat or something.  What happened to him?  Something happened to him. Q    Are you still — THE PRESIDENT:  It was a little — it looked like he got hit.  It looked like he got beat around, but — Q    So, did — did you invite him or — THE PRESIDENT:  But I’ll ask Karoline to find out what happened to him.  No, if he wanted to come out, I would have done that.  But I don’t know.  I — somebody said that he wanted to come on the plane, but I think he’s staying back for the votes.  There’s some pretty good votes going on. Yeah. Q    Mr. President, what is your timeline for getting rid of FEMA? THE PRESIDENT:  I — I woul- — for the — for this one?  For this one?  Well — Q    For — you just talked about possibly getting rid of FEMA.  What timeline are you looking at, and how would you do that? THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re looking here — here, you’re talking about.  To start — we’re going to start immediately — timeline.   And to finish, it’s going to be a period of time.  You know, people are also rebuilding their houses.  How long does it take to build a house, right?  It takes a time. And I want them to build houses bigger, better, nicer than they had before, so they can have — at least they get something out of this disaster.  This was a real disaster. No, timeline will be fast.  In terms of infrastructure, I think very fast.  I want to thank Elon, because Elon was able to get us communication systems, as you know — Starlink.  We had no communication.  The first day I got here, I was asked by one of the people, one of the really great representatives, professionals that — “Is there any way you could get Starlink here,” because they had no communication whatsoever.  And I called up Elon Musk, and he had, you know, hundreds of units brought here — like, brought immediately.  And it’s hard to get; they couldn’t get them before.  And that made a lot of difference.  I think it saved a lot of lives, actually. Yeah.  Infrastructure-wise, we’ll do it quickly. Q    Sir, can you just talk about how long you might — do you think it might take to get rid of FEMA?  What’s the timeline on that if you’re going to roll it back? THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  I would say, look, as far as I’m concerned, I’m not really thinking about FEMA right now here.  I’m thinking about Michael Whatley, and I’m thinking about the three congresspeople that you just heard from and also the other people in Congress.  And they’ll be working with the governor.  They’ll be working with the governor.  So, that’s what I see. Q    Change of subject real quickly.  The Laken Riley Act was signed by Mike — Speaker Johnson yesterday.  When do you — THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah. Q    — when do you anticipate to put — to sign that in the Oval Office?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re honored by that.  Laken Riley — I was there at the time, and we had a big meeting with the parents right after that horrible thing took place.  And we have a — an act.  You all know what that act represents.  And it was a bipartisan bill.  Many Democrats signed — signed on to it.  That’s something that is a tribute to Laken, a beautiful young lady who was killed viciously by an illegal alien.  And we passed a very powerful bill, and it was just approved.  And we’ll have a ceremony sometime very shortly. I’ll be signing it.  In other words, if you’re asking, I will definitely be signing it.  Okay? Yeah. Q    Mr. President, the security detail for Anthony Fauci was terminated last night, and I’m wondering if you have any comment on that? THE PRESIDENT:  About what? Q    The security detail for Anthony Fauci was terminated last night, sir.  Do you have a comment? THE PRESIDENT:  No, I think, you know, when you work for govern- — government, at some point, your security detail comes off.  And, you know, you can’t have them forever.  So, I think it’s very standard.  If it would be for somebody else, you wouldn’t be asking the question.  The question is very fair, but, you know, you work for government — we took some off other people too — but you can’t have a security detail for the rest of your life because you worked for government. Q    Did you ask for it to be taken off, sir? THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’ll see what happens. Q    Would you feel partially responsible if something were to happen to, say, Dr. Fauci — THE PRESIDENT:  No. Q    — or John Bolton? THE PRESIDENT:  No.  You know, they all made a lot of money.  They can hire their own security too.  All the people you’re talking about, they can go out — I can give them some good numbers of very good security people.  They can hire their own security.  They all made a lot of money.  Fauci made a lot of money.  They all did.  So, if they, you know, felt that strongly, I — I think that — certainly, I would not take responsibility. Q    North Carolina is a state that relies on trade and manufacturing.  Are you going to have an announcement on new tariffs coming soon?  Is there a timeline now? THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, the tariffs are going to make our country rich.  We’re going to be a rich, rich country very soon.  Tariffs are going to make it rich.  And competence — we have common sense, competence, and tariffs.  The word “tariff” is one of the most beautiful words in the dictionary.  Q    Jonathan Reynolds, the — the business secretary of the United Kingdom, said that there’s an even trade between the U.S. and — and the UK, so they shouldn’t have tariffs.  Does trade imbalances or a balanced trade affect tariffs and your decisions? THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, ba- — unbalance and balance, and also deficits, like with Canada.  We lose $200 billion a year with Canada.  That’s because we allow them to make cars.  We allow them to take lumber.  We don’t need their cars.  We don’t need their lumber.  We don’t need their food products because we make the same products right on the other side of the border.  It’s sort of crazy.  So, we’ve just allowed that — you know, bad management has allowed it, over the last four years, in particular, to become very imbalanced.  And I said to — I call him “Governor Trudeau,” but he’s Prime Minister Trudeau — when he was prime minister, I asked him, “Why would we do that?  Why?”  And he was unable to give me an answer.  He said, “I don’t know.”  And I said, “Do you think it’s fair that we’re paying $200 billion to keep Canada going?”  “And what would happen” — I said — I asked him, “What would happen if we didn’t do that, if we didn’t subsidize Canada?”  He said, “We’d be a failed nation.”  And I said, “Then you should be a state,” because why are we paying all of that money to Canada when, you know, we — we could use it ourselves, right? So, we take care of their military.  You know, we ordered — we’re going to order about 40 Coast Guard big icebreakers.  Big ones.  And all of a sudden, Canada wants a piece of the deal.  I say, “Why are we doing that?” I mean, I like doing that if they’re a state, but I don’t like doing that if they’re a nation. Also, they’ve been very nasty to us on trade.  Historically, Canada has been very, very bad to us, very unfair to us on trade.  So, we’ll see how it all works out. Q    So, the United Kingdom — THE PRESIDENT:  I would — Q    — might be in a better spot? THE PRESIDENT:  I would love to see Canada be the 51st state.  The Canadian citizens, if that happened, would get a very big tax cut — tremendous tax cut — because they’re very high- — highly taxed.  And you wouldn’t have to worry about military.  You wouldn’t have to worry about many of the things.  You’d have better health coverage.  You’d have much better health coverage.  So, I think the people of Canada would like it, you know, if it’s explained.   But I — just to start off, they’d have a very — they’d have a massive tax cut, and they’d have a lot more business, because then we’d let business go to Canada routinely.  And there’d be no tariffs.  You know, if we did that, there’d be no tariffs. Q    So, the United Kingdom might be in a better spot, then? Q    Can you talk about Samaritan’s Purse?  Reverend Franklin Graham has been a great asset to this state.  Talk a little bit about the way the Samaritan Purse has helped North Carolinians. THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, say it once again.  The first — Q    Reverend Franklin Graham has been a big part of Samaritan Purse and their aid to North Carolina.  I just want to get your thoughts on that.
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  Well, Franklin Graham has been a big asset to the state.  His father was a big asset to the state, to the country — both of them.  I just think this: I think Franklin and — and other people that are doing what Franklin have done — but I — you know, I’ve known Franklin so long.  He was at the inauguration.  He made a speech, beautiful speech; beautiful prayer.  He just — he does a great job.  And we gave — we made a big donation, and it was — it was money well spent.  Sometimes you make donations, it’s not well spent.  He’s done a great job here.  He’s done a really great job. So, I want to thank you.  We’re going to the site now, and — one of the sites — and we’ll — I think you’ll — for those that haven’t seen it, you won’t even believe it, but not enough work was done.  We’ll get it done fast.  And I can speak for the Republican congressmen, we’re going to knock it out, right?  We’re going to knock it out.  And I think we take it very personally, because it was — North Carolina was very unfairly treated — very, very unfairly treated.  And it was obvious.  It was too obvious.  And we’re going to make up for lost time.  So, thank you to the people of North Carolina.
Thank you, everybody.

the people that he s got have done amazing work so i just want to thank everybody we re going to get over and take a look we ll say a few words i want to just i do want to introduce some of the people that we have and our first lady we ll start with our first lady she wanted to be here because of north carolina and then i said well you can do that but you re going to have to come to california too laughter the first lady that s okay the president and she said that s okay laughter and we got to fix that one up too that s who do you ever see anything like that one it s who would have who would have thought that could have happened so governor josh stein thank you very much we appreciate it and we re going to have a a very long and good relationship representatives maybe stand up if you would so we the press can see representatives chuck edwards chuck thank you thank you chuck tim moore virginia you know virginia foxx a legend she is such a powerful woman pat harrigan pat thank you very much your agriculture commissioner who i hear is excellent steve troxler steve thank you very much good job steve you ve got plenty to do right mr troxler inaudible the president laughs more than you ever thought north carolina speaker destin hall thank you destin thanks destin very good house majority leader brenden jones brenden thank you very much we re making progress brenden state representatives dudley greene karl gillespie thank you very much fellas good good thank you very much state senators kevin corbin warren daniel thank you thank you very much kevin warren and county commissioner jennifer best thank you jennifer thank you so hurricane helene was one of the worst natural disasters in american history it was far worse than it was even billed i have never seen such water damage it was largely water damage wind damage but water damage nobody has ever seen i ve been here as you know numerous times but now i m here in a position where we can do something meaning i ve been in in office for four days and i wanted to come sooner but actually they had a little problem with getting logistically in here but i would have been ev here even sooner one oh four a hundred and four north carolinians have at least have lost their lives is that now a fairly firm number or are they still finding people you know is what do you think they re still finding people pretty much okay it s a lot of people a hundred and four people lost their lives seventy three thousand homes were severely damaged or destroyed and i ll tell you i ve been to a lot of them and this was a this was like lots of hurricanes in one i ve never seen such damage done by water and the the water came it was violent and it left and there was like nothing left it s really pretty amazing at one point half of the emergency calls to fema went unanswered that s real bad fema was not doing their job the city of asheville went without running water for two months a whistleblower testified that some fema employees refused to help people who displayed trump signs on their properties i think that s true isn t it i read that that s not nice that s not too nice is it but whoever those property people were thank you very much michael is that true mr whatley inaudible the president that s not good huh about the property owners you put a trump sign on it they wouldn t help fema earlier this year fema kicked north carolinians out of their temporary housing into below freezing temperatures what was that all about is that do you know about that what happened tell me state speaker hall we had an incompetent administration under biden and we had a disaster and then we call it the disaster after the disaster that was the fema response the president you had nothing but disaster since then i it doesn t matter at this point biden did a bad job some residents still don t have hot water drinking water or anything else and m many of them don t have quarters they don t have anything they got a stipend for what they lost and we re going to take care of it this is totally unacceptable and i ll be taking strong action to get north carolina the support that you need to quickly recover and rebuild we re working on it very hard and i think if michael whatley does half as good a job for north carolina as he did for my campaign we ll be very happy laughter him and lara were a very powerful team so you think you can handle it michael i don t know i m not sure michael laughter i think this is maybe in many ways easier okay maybe easier but you re going to lead the team do you want to say who the who the congressmen are that you want to appoint do you want to introduce them mr whatley so we we have virginia foxx and chuck edwards and tim moore the president and mr whatley whose districts encompass the area inaudible the president and they are the districts that were most severely impacted right you were you were affected then virginia representative foxx yes sir lost my own property the president really well i ll also be signing an executive order to begin the process of fundamentally reforming and overhauling fema or maybe getting rid of fema i think frankly fema is not good i think when you have a problem like this i think you want to go and whether it s a democrat or a republican governor you want to use your state to fix it and not waste time calling fema and then fema gets here and they don t know the area they ve never been to the area and they want to give you rules that you ve never heard about they want to bring people that aren t as good as the people you already have and fema has turned out to be a a disaster and you could go back a long way you could go back to louisiana you could go back to some of the things that took place in texas it it turns out to be the state that ends up doing the work it just complicates it i think we re going to recommend that fema go away and we pay directly we pay a percentage to the state but the state should fix this if the state did this from the beginning it would have been a lot better situation i think you guys agree with that right so i just want to tell that ash say that asheville i know it well it s a great place and we re going to have it be a great place again that was the one that was most severely affected but north carolina is going to come back bigger better stronger than ever before and you re going to be very thankful and you ve already seen i know that it really began four days ago but you ve already seen more action than you have in the last three months and we re going to get it together we re informing the army corps of engineers to get going because you have a lot of river breaks and a lot of areas that you re going to need some pretty big work and they re on their way they re going to be working very much harder than they ve been working in the past and we re going to take care of it any questions from the press of any of the congressmen governor anybody q sir are you going to sign an executive order on fema getting rid of it can you explain more about signing the executive order to get rid of fema please the president fema has been a very big disappointment they cost a tremendous amount of money it s very bureaucratic and it s very slow other than that we re very happy with them okay laughter and i think it s i think when there s a when there s a problem with the state i think that that problem should be taken care of by the state that s what we have states for they take care of problems and a governor can handle something very quickly you know one of the things i ve noticed because i ve been doing this for a while and we had a pretty good fema but i also noticed that when they come they end up in arguments of they re fighting all the time over who does what it s a just a it s just not a good system this system is so beautifully designed over years approximately you know and we ll soon be celebrating the th year it s going to be a very big celebration but it s been designed very well and we re going to leave it that way when north carolina south carolina florida tennessee when everybody knows the governor of tennessee i think everybody do you do you know everybody here pretty much he s o governor lee i i ve introduced myself the president i never thought of it but you re right over the ridge right governor lee right over the hi right over the hillside the president so so you re here to help that s great governor lee these here thi the people in this region including tennessee the people of appalachia are grateful that you are here and that you haven t forgotten them the president yeah governor lee and that there are other disasters but this one was enormous for both north carolina and tennessee so thank you the president you know i ve seen a lot of disasters and this when i came i came here right after the day after and when i came here i couldn t believe it actually i couldn t believe the damage i and i ve seen a lot of them this was this was more like a tornado than it was what we witnessed so we re going to get it very much very much taken care of good job that s nice that you came governor lee thank you sir the president and so you call it right you re right over the ridge right tennessee governor lee right over the ridge yes sir the president i like tennessee too let s see where did i get more votes tennessee or north carolina i hate laughter i hate to tell you north carolina it was tennessee governor lee there s one of the counties in this disaster that had percent for you so inaudible the president eighty eight percent yeah that s the people are just incredible people governor lee yeah the president so do you have any questions press q yes mr president you talked about conditions being placed on aid to california voter id and the like are there any conditions that you re going to put on aid to north carolina the president oh we re going to do a lot for north carolina you know they ve been very slow i don t know why it s been so bad this has been one of the worst i ve seen katrina of course you know was somebo something that obviously that was a long time ago that was not good but this has been very slow i don t know if that was for political reasons because they lost the state you know biden lost the state maybe he felt he doesn t care maybe there were other reasons i don t know but this has been very slow by any standard this has been very slow and we re going to we re going to make up for lost time q but no conditions you re going to push for aid just full stop the president well in california i have a condition in california we want them to have voter id so the people have a voice because right now the people don t have a voice because you don t know who s voting and it s very corrupt and we also want them to release the water if they release the water they wouldn t have had a problem if they released the water when i told them to because i told them to do it seven years ago if they would have done it you wouldn t have had the problem that you had you might have you might not have even had a fire so but here i don t have that it s a different thing you got hit by a storm the people are incredible they worked really well franklin was fantastic and other groups by the way other groups came in that were also fantastic and other states came in tennessee and a couple of others came in and they really helped that s the way it s supposed to be no this is a different kind of a thing q mr president have you decided how much funding you would allocate for disaster relief in north carolina the president about what q have you decided how much funding you would allocate for disaster relief the president i haven t de i have to see what it is q mr president q are are are you disappointed that senator schiff hasn t joined you on this trip it s reported that you invited senator schiff to join you on this trip and he was too busy are you disappointed by that the president i don t know i i was told that schiff was going to travel with us to california i wasn t thrilled to be honest with you laughter and i saw him last night on television it looks like he got hit with a baseball bat or something what happened to him something happened to him q are you still the president it was a little it looked like he got hit it looked like he got beat around but q so did did you invite him or the president but i ll ask karoline to find out what happened to him no if he wanted to come out i would have done that but i don t know i somebody said that he wanted to come on the plane but i think he s staying back for the votes there s some pretty good votes going on yeah q mr president what is your timeline for getting rid of fema the president i i woul for the for this one for this one well q for you just talked about possibly getting rid of fema what timeline are you looking at and how would you do that the president well we re looking here here you re talking about to start we re going to start immediately timeline and to finish it s going to be a period of time you know people are also rebuilding their houses how long does it take to build a house right it takes a time and i want them to build houses bigger better nicer than they had before so they can have at least they get something out of this disaster this was a real disaster no timeline will be fast in terms of infrastructure i think very fast i want to thank elon because elon was able to get us communication systems as you know starlink we had no communication the first day i got here i was asked by one of the people one of the really great representatives professionals that is there any way you could get starlink here because they had no communication whatsoever and i called up elon musk and he had you know hundreds of units brought here like brought immediately and it s hard to get they couldn t get them before and that made a lot of difference i think it saved a lot of lives actually yeah infrastructure wise we ll do it quickly q sir can you just talk about how long you might do you think it might take to get rid of fema what s the timeline on that if you re going to roll it back the president yeah i would say look as far as i m concerned i m not really thinking about fema right now here i m thinking about michael whatley and i m thinking about the three congresspeople that you just heard from and also the other people in congress and they ll be working with the governor they ll be working with the governor so that s what i see q change of subject real quickly the laken riley act was signed by mike speaker johnson yesterday when do you the president yeah q when do you anticipate to put to sign that in the oval office the president well we re honored by that laken riley i was there at the time and we had a big meeting with the parents right after that horrible thing took place and we have a an act you all know what that act represents and it was a bipartisan bill many democrats signed signed on to it that s something that is a tribute to laken a beautiful young lady who was killed viciously by an illegal alien and we passed a very powerful bill and it was just approved and we ll have a ceremony sometime very shortly i ll be signing it in other words if you re asking i will definitely be signing it okay yeah q mr president the security detail for anthony fauci was terminated last night and i m wondering if you have any comment on that the president about what q the security detail for anthony fauci was terminated last night sir do you have a comment the president no i think you know when you work for govern government at some point your security detail comes off and you know you can t have them forever so i think it s very standard if it would be for somebody else you wouldn t be asking the question the question is very fair but you know you work for government we took some off other people too but you can t have a security detail for the rest of your life because you worked for government q did you ask for it to be taken off sir the president well we ll see what happens q would you feel partially responsible if something were to happen to say dr fauci the president no q or john bolton the president no you know they all made a lot of money they can hire their own security too all the people you re talking about they can go out i can give them some good numbers of very good security people they can hire their own security they all made a lot of money fauci made a lot of money they all did so if they you know felt that strongly i i think that certainly i would not take responsibility q north carolina is a state that relies on trade and manufacturing are you going to have an announcement on new tariffs coming soon is there a timeline now the president yeah the tariffs are going to make our country rich we re going to be a rich rich country very soon tariffs are going to make it rich and competence we have common sense competence and tariffs the word tariff is one of the most beautiful words in the dictionary q jonathan reynolds the the business secretary of the united kingdom said that there s an even trade between the u s and and the uk so they shouldn t have tariffs does trade imbalances or a balanced trade affect tariffs and your decisions the president yeah ba unbalance and balance and also deficits like with canada we lose $ billion a year with canada that s because we allow them to make cars we allow them to take lumber we don t need their cars we don t need their lumber we don t need their food products because we make the same products right on the other side of the border it s sort of crazy so we ve just allowed that you know bad management has allowed it over the last four years in particular to become very imbalanced and i said to i call him governor trudeau but he s prime minister trudeau when he was prime minister i asked him why would we do that why and he was unable to give me an answer he said i don t know and i said do you think it s fair that we re paying $ billion to keep canada going and what would happen i said i asked him what would happen if we didn t do that if we didn t subsidize canada he said we d be a failed nation and i said then you should be a state because why are we paying all of that money to canada when you know we we could use it ourselves right so we take care of their military you know we ordered we re going to order about coast guard big icebreakers big ones and all of a sudden canada wants a piece of the deal i say why are we doing that i mean i like doing that if they re a state but i don t like doing that if they re a nation also they ve been very nasty to us on trade historically canada has been very very bad to us very unfair to us on trade so we ll see how it all works out q so the united kingdom the president i would q might be in a better spot the president i would love to see canada be the st state the canadian citizens if that happened would get a very big tax cut tremendous tax cut because they re very high highly taxed and you wouldn t have to worry about military you wouldn t have to worry about many of the things you d have better health coverage you d have much better health coverage so i think the people of canada would like it you know if it s explained but i just to start off they d have a very they d have a massive tax cut and they d have a lot more business because then we d let business go to canada routinely and there d be no tariffs you know if we did that there d be no tariffs q so the united kingdom might be in a better spot then q can you talk about samaritan s purse reverend franklin graham has been a great asset to this state talk a little bit about the way the samaritan purse has helped north carolinians the president yeah say it once again the first q reverend franklin graham has been a big part of samaritan purse and their aid to north carolina i just want to get your thoughts on that the president yeah well franklin graham has been a big asset to the state his father was a big asset to the state to the country both of them i just think this i think franklin and and other people that are doing what franklin have done but i you know i ve known franklin so long he was at the inauguration he made a speech beautiful speech beautiful prayer he just he does a great job and we gave we made a big donation and it was it was money well spent sometimes you make donations it s not well spent he s done a great job here he s done a really great job so i want to thank you we re going to the site now and one of the sites and we ll i think you ll for those that haven t seen it you won t even believe it but not enough work was done we ll get it done fast and i can speak for the republican congressmen we re going to knock it out right we re going to knock it out and i think we take it very personally because it was north carolina was very unfairly treated very very unfairly treated and it was obvious it was too obvious and we re going to make up for lost time so thank you to the people of north carolina thank you everybody na

2:38 P.M. EST     THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.  Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.  This is a very big day for a lot of reasons, but this gentleman is a very unique man.  I think I can say, in the world of chips, certainly, but in the world pretty much of business, nobody has done what he’s done.  For those of you that are into that world, you would say, “Wow, he’s a legend.”  But he is a legend.  And it’s an honor to be with you.  Very great honor.  Thank you very much.
MR. WEI:  Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
Welcoming, from TSMC — which is the biggest there is, at a level that you can’t even calculate, frankly — C.C. Wei, to the White House for a very historic announcement.  This is a tremendous thing for our country and, hopefully, for his company.
We’re also pleased to be joined by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and White House AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, another two very highly respected people.  It’s great to have you guys involved.  And, David, thank you very much for coming on.
David is sort of the king of intellect in that world.  We have some good people.     Today, Taiwan Semiconductor is announcing that they will be investing at least $100 billion dollars in new capital in the United States over the next short period of time to build state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facilities.  I think, mostly, it’s going to be in Arizona, which is what I understand, which is a great state.  I like it because I won it.  But I won most of them — (laughs) — actually.  So — but I did.  We won it, and we won it big.
The most powerful AI chips in the world will be made right here in America, and it’ll be a big percentage of the chips made by his company.  But, as you know, they’re based mostly in Taiwan.  And they’re far and away the biggest.  There’s nobody even close.
This $100 billion in new investment will go into building five cutting-edge fabrication facilities in the great state that we just discussed, Arizona, and will create thousands of jobs — many thousands of jobs, and they’re high-paying jobs.     In total, today’s announcement brings Taiwan Semiconductor investments to about $165 billion — they’ve started already — among the largest new foreign direct investments in United States.
Apple, as you know, made a big announcement last week of $500 billion, and we have some others that have announced.      We have many that want to announce.  But I don’t have time to do all of these announcements, I tell you.  But, for you, I’m doing the announcement.
MR. WEI:  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  This will create hundreds of billions of dollars in economic activity and boost America’s dominance in artificial intelligence and beyond.
Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st century economy — and, really, without the semiconductors, there is no economy — powering everything from AI to automobiles to advanced manufacturing.  And we must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here, in American factories, with American skill and American labor.  And that’s exactly what we’re doing.
As you know, Taiwan pretty much has a monopoly on that market.  And I think “pretty much” is not a term that’s even appropriate.  They do have a monopoly.  And this is a tremendous move by the most powerful company in the world.
It’s a matter of economic security.  It’s also a matter of national security for us.  And, at the same time, Mr. Wei will be able to diversify and have his tremendous presence in another place and a very safe place.  And I want to thank Taiwan Semiconductor for doing the announcement.
And I’d like to ask Mr. Wei to say a few words, if you might.
And I’d also like to ask Howard and David — you can say a couple of words.  But maybe you should go first because, right now, he’s the most important man in the room.  I’m sorry, fellas.
Please.
Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Great honor.
MR. WEI:  Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
MR. WEI:  I’m a — I’m a little bit nervous, so I have to pull out my piece of paper.
Mr. President, Secretary Lutnick — and, David, I didn’t know that — your title, but — okay.
First, I want to thank — say thank you to Mr. President to give me this opportunity to announce our big project in the U.S. TSMC is the world’s largest chip manufacturing, founded by Dr. Morris Chang in 1987.  It’s now at the forefront of semiconductor technology, supporting AI advancement and industry growth.
In fact, I would like to wind back the time that in 2020 we have to thank President Trump’s vision and his support.  So, TSMC start the journey of establishing the advanced chip manufacturing in Arizona.  And now, let me proudly say, now the vision become reality.
In Phoenix, Arizona, with 3,000 employees, we are producing the most advanced chip made on U.S. soil with the success of our first fab.
So, we are now very happy to announce we are going to invest additional 100 billion U.S. dollar in addition to our current 65-billion-U.S.-dollars investment in Arizona.  We are going to build three more new fab — be- — after we promised the three fabs already, and another two very advanced packaging fab, and, most important, an R&D center, also in Arizona.
For this, all the investment — $165 billion — is going to create thousand of the high-paid job, as the president just announced.  And we are, most important — actually, we are going to produce many AI chips.  We are going to produce many chips to support AI’s progress and to support the smartphone’s progress. And, again, with that, I want to thank President Trump again for his support.  In addition, I also want to thank my customers in the U.S., such as Apple, Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, Broadcom.  They all support TSMC’s manufacturing in the U.S.  Without their support, we probably cannot make it true. So, again, I want to thank them.  Also, I’d like to thank the TSMC’s employee.  Without their effort, we just cannot make it today. That’s all I want to say.  And thank you. THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That’s great.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much. Howard, please.  David.SECRETARY LUTNICK:  Sure.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you. SECRETARY LUTNICK:  So, I’m thrilled to be here today, because President Trump has made it a fundamental objective to bring semiconductor chip manufacturing home to America. Under the Biden administration, TSMC received a $6 billion grant, and that encouraged them to build $65 billion.  So, America gave TSMC 10 percent of the money to build here.  And now you’re seeing the power of Donald Trump’s presidency, because TSMC, the greatest manufacturer of chips in the world, is coming to America with $100 billion investment.  And, of course, that is backed by the fact that they can come here because they can avoid paying tariffs. So, the idea is: Come to America.  Build greatness in America.  Build for the American customers — the Apple, Nvidia, that whole list that Chairman Wei gave — in order to bring production to America. So, we’re really, really excited.  This continues the most incredible path you’ve ever seen, in these first weeks and months of the Trump administration, of incredible manufacturing coming to America.  The keys that the president has called out are coming here.  They’re coming here in huge size because they want to be in the greatest market in the world, and they want to avoid the tariffs that, if they’re not here, they’d have to suffer. So, I want to congratulate C.C. Wei for bringing in this incredible $100 billion investment, but it’s on the shoulders of our president, Donald Trump, which is why he’s coming. So, thank you.  THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.David.  MR. SACKS:  Thank you, sir.  Well, the products that TSMC makes are literally the most important products in the world.  I mean, these advanced chips power everything.  They power AI.  They power your phone.  They power your cars.  And without them, the whole modern economy would stop, but they’re not made in the United States. So, for TSMC to move here is a huge, huge development, and we owe that to President Trump’s leadership on the economy and Secretary Lutnick as well.  And, C.C., thank you for — for coming here. Thank you.  Yeah.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, David. So, thank you very much.  A big percentage of chips with this investment will be made now — a big percentage.  Worldwide, we had very little.  Almost none.  We used to have a lot with Intel.  But we had very little.  And we’ll be at close to 40 percent of the market with this transaction and a couple of others that we’re doing.  That’s a tremendous leap — like, a leap that nobody would have really said was possible. So, I just want to thank you all for being here.  If you want a couple of questions.(Cross-talk.)Q    On the — THE PRESIDENT:  Ideally on this subject. Yes, please. Q    — specific number of jobs it will create.   He said thousands —THE PRESIDENT:  They — yeah.Q    — but do you have a better —THE PRESIDENT:  They — you’re probably talking about 25,000 jobs.  But it’ll get bigger and bigger with time.  Knowing this gentleman, it’ll get bigger and bigger.  There’ll be no stopping him.  (Laughs.)Q    Mr. President, what more —THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  Brian, go ahead.Q    Right.  In addition to the jobs, you talked about national security, and that’s one thing I think a lot of Americans —THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah. Q    — at home don’t understand.  Explain the national security aspect of this. THE PRESIDENT:  Well, without the chips and semiconductors, nothing runs today.  You can’t buy a car without them.  You can’t get a radio, a television, nothing — you can’t get anything.  And we thought it was very important — obviously, business was, but we thought even to terms of national security, to have this large percentage of the chips, semiconductors, and other things that they make — the most important product, and not a product that you can really copy.  It takes years and years.  You’re on the needle of a pin is total genius.  I mean, they can put things — I mean, something the size of the needle, the point of a pin, they put information that is just not even believable. So, if you would — (Cross-talk.) If you would see this, it’s just really something. Yes, Brian. Q    Can I — one — one more aspect to that.  Honda —THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah. Q    — announced they’re coming to Indiana because of the tariffs.  Once again —THE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.Q    — you’re bringing additional jobs in manufacturing.  Do you want to comment on that as well?THE PRESIDENT:  Well, Honda is coming, and I told you about Apple, that they’re going to be starting to build massively here — $500 billion.  And we have many other companies.  It’s going to be announced, but we had many that have already announced.  And no, it’s going to be great.  It’s looking — it’s looking really strong.  I don’t think this country has ever seen anything like we’re seeing right now. Now, the tariffs, as you know, it will start a week earlier than the reciprocal, which is going to be on — a couple of weeks earlier.  Reciprocal tariffs start on April 2nd.  And I wanted to make it April 1st, but I didn’t want to do — I didn’t want to go April Fool’s Day — (laughter) — because that cost me — that costs a lot of money, but — that one day.  So, we’re going April 2nd.But very importantly, tomorrow, tariffs — 25 percent on Canada and 25 percent on Mexico, and that’ll start.  So, they’re going to have to have a tariff.  So, what they’ll have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States — in which case, they have no tariffs.  In other words, you build — and this is exactly what Mr. Wei is doing by building here.  Otherwise, they’ll build — if they did them in Taiwan to send them here, they’ll have 25 percent or 30 percent or 50 percent or whatever the number may be someday.  It’ll go only up.  But by doing it here, he has no tariffs, so he’s way ahead of the game. And I would just say this to people in Canada or Mexico, if they’re going to build car plants, the people that are doing them are much better off building here, because we have the market.  We’re the market where they sell the most.  And so, I think it’s going to be very exciting.  Very exciting for the automobile companies.  Very exciting for — I can think of any — as an example, North Carolina, they had the great — I used to go there to buy furniture for hotels, and it’s been wiped out.  That business all went to other countries, and now it’s all going to come back into North Carolina — the furniture manufacturing business.Please.  Q    Mr. President —Q    Is the Ukraine minerals deal now dead, or can it be revived?  What — what’s your —THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’ll let you know.  We’re making a speech — you probably heard about it — tomorrow night, so I’ll let you know tomorrow night. But, no, I don’t think so.  I think it’s — look, it’s a great deal for us, because, you know, Biden very, very, foolishly — stupidly, frankly — gave $300 billion and — $350 billion, more accurately — to a country to fight and to try and do things.  And you know what happened?  We get nothing.  We get nothing — just gave it. We could have rebuilt our entire U.S. Navy with $350 billion.  Think of it.  Three hundred and fifty billion, we could have rebuilt our U.S. Navy.So, he gave it away as fast as the money could be gone.  And what we’re doing is getting that all back and a lot more than that.  And what we need — it’s very important for this business that we’re talking about here, with chips and semiconductors and everything else — we need rare earths.  And the deal we have is we have the finest rare earths that you can. Q    Sir, on Ukraine.  Sir, on Ukraine.
Q    Are you going to press back —Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  What do you need to see from President Zelenskyy to restart these negotiations?THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I just think he should be more appreciative, because this country has stuck with them through thick and thin.  We’ve given them much more than Europe, and Europe should have given more than us, because, as you know, that’s right there.  That’s the border. This country really was like the fence on the border.  It was very important to Europe.  And I’m not knocking Europe, I’m saying they’re just — they were a lot smarter than Joe Biden, because Joe Biden didn’t have a clue.  He just gave money hand over a fist, and they should have been able to equalize with us. In other words, if we gave a dollar, they should have given.  Well, we gave $350 billion.  They probably gave 100, but on top of it all, they get their money back, because they are doing it in the form of a loan, and it’s a secured loan.  So, when I saw that, which I’ve known about for a little while, I said, “It’s time for us to be smart.”  At the same time, it’s great for them, because they get us in the country taking the rare earth, which is going to fuel this big engine, and especially the engine that we’ve, in a very short time, created.  And we get something, and we’re in the — we’re there.  We have a presence there. With all of that being said, I want one thing to happen: I want all of those young people to stop being killed.  They’re being killed by the thousands every single week.  Last week, 2,700 were killed.  Twenty-seven hundred young — in this case, just about, all young boys from Ukraine and from Russia.  And that’s not young people from the United States, but it’s on a human basis. I want to see it stop.  The money is one thing, but the death.  And they’re losing thousands of soldiers a week, and that’s not including the people that get killed every time a town goes down or a missile goes into a town.(Cross-talk.)We — and — and I want to see it stop. Yes.  Q    Mr. President, are you considering canceling military aid to Ukraine?  And can we get a reaction to what the Kremlin just said, that your administration is bringing U.S. worldview in alignment with Moscow’s?  THE PRESIDENT:  So, this is a deal that should have never happened.  This is a deal that would have never happened, and it didn’t happen — for four years, it didn’t happen.  It was never even close to happening.  If I were president, would not have happened.  And October 7th would have — would not have happened in Israel.  And inflation wouldn’t have happened. And Afghanistan, disastrous — the way they withdrew — not the fact that they withdrew but the way they withdrew — would have never happened.  And we would have had Bagram right now instead of China having it.  It was one hour away from where China makes their nuclear weapons.  We would have kept Bagram — one of the biggest air bases in the world. All of these things happened, and it’s a shame.  But it is what it is, and now we’re here.  I want to see it end fast.  I don’t want to see this go on for years and years.Now, President Zelenskyy supposedly made a statement today in AP — I’m not a big fan of AP, so maybe it was an incorrect statement — but he said he thinks the war is going to go on for a long time, and he better not be right about that.  That’s all I’ll say.Q    Mr. President, is there any —
Q    Could this project — could this minimize the impact of the U.S. with chips should China decide to isolate Taiwan or China decide to take Taiwan? THE PRESIDENT:  Well, it’s a very interesting point.  It’s a great question, actually.  But this would certainly — I can’t say “minimize.”  That would be a catastrophic event, obviously.  But it will at least give us a position where we have — in this very, very important business, we would have a very big part of it in the United States.  So, it would have a big impact if something should happen with Taiwan.Q    And with Russia sanctions, are you looking at relieving Russian sanctions if there is a peace deal?THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re going to make deals with everybody to get this war, including Europe and European nations.  And they’ve acted very well.  You know, they’re good people.  I know; most of them are friends of mine — the heads of state, the heads of the various countries, prime ministers from the different — I got four prime ministers and five presidents called me over the last two days, and they want to work it out.  They want to get it worked out.  And I think they’re also — you know, they’re talking money, but the money is less important than the deaths.  We’re talking thousands of young people a week.  And people would say why do I care about Ukraine, young people; why do I care about — and not all young, but they’re pretty young.  You know, Ukraine is running a little bit low, and they’re getting older.  They’re recruiting older people.  It’s a very, very sad thing that’s happening over there, and we want to get it finished.  We want to stop the death. (Cross-talk.)Q    Mr. President, on the tariffs.  Is there any room left for Canada and Mexico to make a deal before midnight?  And should we expect those Chinese tariffs, the extra 10 percent to take effect tomorrow?THE PRESIDENT:  No room left for Mexico or for Canada.  No, the tariffs, you know, they’re all set.  They go into effect tomorrow.Q    Mr. President, just a follow-up on my colleague’s question.  Hearing —THE PRESIDENT:  And just so you understand, vast amounts of fentanyl have poured into our country from Mexico and, as you know, also from China, where it goes to Mexico and goes to Canada.  And China also had an additional 10, so it’s 10 plus 10.  And it comes in from Canada, and it comes in from Mexico, and that’s a very important thing to say.Yeah, please.  Go ahead.Q    Have you decided if you’re going to suspend military aid to Ukraine?  Have you made that decision?THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I haven’t even talked about that right now.  I mean, right now, we’ll see what happens.  A lot of things are happening right now, as we speak — I mean, literally as we speak.  I could give you an answer and go back to my office — the beautiful Oval Office.  I could go back into the Oval Office and find out that the answer is obsolete.     It’s like his business.  It’s obsolete.  You come up with a new chip, and it’s obsolete about two minutes later, right?  But that’s what’s good about his business.  That’s why he’s the only one that’s successful in it.  But —      Q    And on tariffs, sir.     Q    Mr. President, just to follow up my colleague’s question from Russia is saying that your foreign policy is largely in line with their vision.  Should that be concerning to Americans? THE PRESIDENT:  Said what?Q    Should that be concerning to Americans?THE PRESIDENT:  Read the statement.Q    That Russia — Russia says that your administration’s foreign policy is, quote, “largely in line” with their vision.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I tell you what, I think it takes two to tango, and you’re going to have to make a deal with Russia, and you’re going to have to make a deal with Ukraine.  You’re going to have to have the ascent, and you’re going to have to have the consent from the European nations, because I think that’s important, and from us. I think everybody has to get into a room, so to speak, and we have to make a deal.  And the deal could be made very fast.  It should not be that hard a deal to make.  It could be made very fast. Now, maybe somebody doesn’t want to make a deal, and if somebody doesn’t want to make a deal, I think that person won’t be around very long.  That person will not be listened to very long.  Because I believe that Russia wants to make a deal.  I believe, certainly, the people of Ukraine want to make a deal.  They’ve suffered more than anybody else.  We talk about suffering — they’ve suffered.But if you think about it, under President Bush, they got Georgia, right?  Russia got Georgia.  Under President Obama, they got a nice, big submarine base, a nice big chunk of land where they have their submarines.  You know that, right?  Crimea.  Under President Trump, they got nothing.  And under President O-Biden, they tried to get the whole thing.  They tried to get the whole big Ukraine, the whole thing.  If I didn’t get in here, they would’ve gotten the whole thing.  So, I can only say — you can go back to Bush, you go back to Obama, and go back to Biden — they took a lot.  The only one they didn’t get — you know what I gave them?  I gave them anti-tank missiles.  That’s what I gave them.  I gave them sanctions on Russia — on Russia.  I gave them Javelins.  You know the Javelins?  You know when they took out all those tanks?You know, the tanks were heading to Kyiv by the hundreds, and they were unstoppable, and I gave them Javelins. So, you know, I really — Putin is the one that will tell you this has not been so good for them.  The fact is that I just want fairness.  I want fairness. But think of it.  I gave Russia nothing except grief.  I gave them nothing.  I gave them sanctions and Javelins.  That’s what I gave them. Obama gave them sheets.  And you heard that statement before.  It’s a very famous — Trump gave them Javelins, and Obama gave them sheets.  And then they say how close I am to Russia. Let me tell you, we have to make a deal, because there are a lot of people being killed that shouldn’t be killed.  But remember, Trump gave them nothing, and the other presidents gave them a lot.  They gave them everything.Q    Mr. President, on trade.  You met with president — Argentine President Javier Milei at CPAC.  He wants to sign a free trade agreement —THE PRESIDENT:  Right. Q    — with the United States.  Is that something that you would consider, even with Argentina, or any other country?THE PRESIDENT:  I’ll consider anything.  And Argentina — I think he’s great, by the way.  I think he’s a great leader.  He’s doing a great job.  He’s doing a fantastic job.  Brought it back from oblivion. Yeah, we’ll look at things.  We’re looking at the UK with things.  It doesn’t have to be tariffs.  But tariffs are easy, they’re fast, they’re efficient, and they bring fairness. For instance, when people kill their dollar, their equivalent of the dollar, whatever — whether it’s the yuan or the yen in Japan or the yuan in China — when they drop them down, that gives us — that puts us at a very unfair disadvantage.  So, all I have to do is say, “Howard, we’re going to have to raise the tariffs a little bit.”Because I’ve called President Xi, I’ve called the leaders of Japan to say, “You can’t continue to reduce and break down your currency.  You can’t do it, because it’s unfair to us.”  It’s very hard for us to make tractors — Caterpillar — here, when Japan, China, and other places are killing their currency, meaning driving it down. So, all of these things add up, and the way you solve it very easily is with tariffs.  Because when they do that, instead of having to make phone calls every day, like I used to do with certain leaders — President Xi, a little bit — a lot of phone calls talking about the fact that they’re lowering their yuan.  They’re lowering it down.  And that makes it very, very hard for us. So, this way, I just say, “Look, let them do that, and we make up for it with the tariffs.”  But —Q    Will you be speaking with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum about tariffs today? THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, sure, I will.  I have a lot of respect for her.  I have a lot of respect for her. (Cross-talk.) Q    After the 10 percent tariff take ef- —THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah. Q    — takes effect, it’ll be 20 percent on China now.  How high are you willing to go against China?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I can’t say.  It depends on what they do with their currency.  It depends on what they do in terms of a retaliation with some kind of an economic retaliation, which I don’t think they’re going to retaliate too much.  Hey, look, the United States has been taken advantage of for 40 years.  The United States has been a laughing stock for years and years.  That’s why this gentleman has built in Taiwan, instead of building here.  It would have been better if he built here.  If we had a president that knew what they were doing — and we had a lot of them very bad on trade.  Look, I’m a huge fan of Ronald Reagan, but he was bad on trade.  Very bad on trade.  He allowed a lot of people, a lot of businesses, to be taken.  So, I say that with due respect, because I — he was so great on other things, but he was bad on trade. We are setting records right now — records like nobody has ever seen before.  When you have companies like this coming in and almost 40 percent of their company, in one signature, is going to be devoted to what he does, which is one of the most important — important businesses in the world, that’s an unbelievable thing.  When Apple now is going to start building all of their plants here, all because of what we’ve done in terms of — it’s not because he likes me or they like me.  They don’t probably like me at all.  I don’t know.  I think he likes me a little bit, at least.  (Laughter.)MR. WEI:  No, I like you.THE PRESIDENT:  But you know what?  It’s the incentive we’ve created or the negative incentive.  I mean, it’s going to be very costly for people to take advantage of this country.  They can’t come in and steal our money and steal our jobs and take our factories and take our businesses and expect not to be punished, and they’re being punished by tariffs.
It’s a very powerful weapon that politicians haven’t used because they were either dishonest, stupid, or paid off in some other form.  And now we’re using them.Q    Have you spoken with President Xi?Q    Agriculture — THE PRESIDENT:  Say it. Q    Have you spoken with President Xi about this this term?THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t want to tell you that. Q    On those incentives, sir.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everybody. (Cross-talk.) Thank you.  Thank you very much.
NA",16,na na p m est the president hello everybody thank you very much thank you very much this is a very big day for a lot of reasons but this gentleman is a very unique man i think i can say in the world of chips certainly but in the world pretty much of business nobody has done what he s done for those of you that are into that world you would say wow he s a legend but he is a legend and it s an honor to be with you very great honor thank you very much mr wei thank you mr president the president thank you very much welcoming from tsmc which is the biggest there is at a level that you can t even calculate frankly c c wei to the white house for a very historic announcement this is a tremendous thing for our country and hopefully for his company we re also pleased to be joined by commerce secretary howard lutnick and white house ai and crypto czar david sacks another two very highly respected people it s great to have you guys involved and david thank you very much for coming on david is sort of the king of intellect in that world we have some good people today taiwan semiconductor is announcing that they will be investing at least $ billion dollars in new capital in the united states over the next short period of time to build state of the art semiconductor manufacturing facilities i think mostly it s going to be in arizona which is what i understand which is a great state i like it because i won it but i won most of them laughs actually so but i did we won it and we won it big the most powerful ai chips in the world will be made right here in america and it ll be a big percentage of the chips made by his company but as you know they re based mostly in taiwan and they re far and away the biggest there s nobody even close this $ billion in new investment will go into building five cutting edge fabrication facilities in the great state that we just discussed arizona and will create thousands of jobs many thousands of jobs and they re high paying jobs in total today s announcement brings taiwan semiconductor investments to about $ billion they ve started already among the largest new foreign direct investments in united states apple as you know made a big announcement last week of $ billion and we have some others that have announced we have many that want to announce but i don t have time to do all of these announcements i tell you but for you i m doing the announcement mr wei thank you the president this will create hundreds of billions of dollars in economic activity and boost america s dominance in artificial intelligence and beyond semiconductors are the backbone of the st century economy and really without the semiconductors there is no economy powering everything from ai to automobiles to advanced manufacturing and we must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here in american factories with american skill and american labor and that s exactly what we re doing as you know taiwan pretty much has a monopoly on that market and i think pretty much is not a term that s even appropriate they do have a monopoly and this is a tremendous move by the most powerful company in the world it s a matter of economic security it s also a matter of national security for us and at the same time mr wei will be able to diversify and have his tremendous presence in another place and a very safe place and i want to thank taiwan semiconductor for doing the announcement and i d like to ask mr wei to say a few words if you might and i d also like to ask howard and david you can say a couple of words but maybe you should go first because right now he s the most important man in the room i m sorry fellas please thank you very much thank you great honor mr wei thank you mr president the president thank you mr wei i m a i m a little bit nervous so i have to pull out my piece of paper mr president secretary lutnick and david i didn t know that your title but okay first i want to thank say thank you to mr president to give me this opportunity to announce our big project in the u s tsmc is the world s largest chip manufacturing founded by dr morris chang in it s now at the forefront of semiconductor technology supporting ai advancement and industry growth in fact i would like to wind back the time that in we have to thank president trump s vision and his support so tsmc start the journey of establishing the advanced chip manufacturing in arizona and now let me proudly say now the vision become reality in phoenix arizona with employees we are producing the most advanced chip made on u s soil with the success of our first fab so we are now very happy to announce we are going to invest additional billion u s dollar in addition to our current billion u s dollars investment in arizona we are going to build three more new fab be after we promised the three fabs already and another two very advanced packaging fab and most important an r d center also in arizona for this all the investment $ billion is going to create thousand of the high paid job as the president just announced and we are most important actually we are going to produce many ai chips we are going to produce many chips to support ai s progress and to support the smartphone s progress and again with that i want to thank president trump again for his support in addition i also want to thank my customers in the u s such as apple nvidia amd qualcomm broadcom they all support tsmc s manufacturing in the u s without their support we probably cannot make it true so again i want to thank them also i d like to thank the tsmc s employee without their effort we just cannot make it today that s all i want to say and thank you the president thank you that s great applause thank you very much howard please david secretary lutnick sure the president thank you secretary lutnick so i m thrilled to be here today because president trump has made it a fundamental objective to bring semiconductor chip manufacturing home to america under the biden administration tsmc received a $ billion grant and that encouraged them to build $ billion so america gave tsmc percent of the money to build here and now you re seeing the power of donald trump s presidency because tsmc the greatest manufacturer of chips in the world is coming to america with $ billion investment and of course that is backed by the fact that they can come here because they can avoid paying tariffs so the idea is come to america build greatness in america build for the american customers the apple nvidia that whole list that chairman wei gave in order to bring production to america so we re really really excited this continues the most incredible path you ve ever seen in these first weeks and months of the trump administration of incredible manufacturing coming to america the keys that the president has called out are coming here they re coming here in huge size because they want to be in the greatest market in the world and they want to avoid the tariffs that if they re not here they d have to suffer so i want to congratulate c c wei for bringing in this incredible $ billion investment but it s on the shoulders of our president donald trump which is why he s coming so thank you the president thank you david mr sacks thank you sir well the products that tsmc makes are literally the most important products in the world i mean these advanced chips power everything they power ai they power your phone they power your cars and without them the whole modern economy would stop but they re not made in the united states so for tsmc to move here is a huge huge development and we owe that to president trump s leadership on the economy and secretary lutnick as well and c c thank you for for coming here thank you yeah the president thank you david so thank you very much a big percentage of chips with this investment will be made now a big percentage worldwide we had very little almost none we used to have a lot with intel but we had very little and we ll be at close to percent of the market with this transaction and a couple of others that we re doing that s a tremendous leap like a leap that nobody would have really said was possible so i just want to thank you all for being here if you want a couple of questions cross talk q on the the president ideally on this subject yes please q specific number of jobs it will create he said thousands the president they yeah q but do you have a better the president they you re probably talking about jobs but it ll get bigger and bigger with time knowing this gentleman it ll get bigger and bigger there ll be no stopping him laughs q mr president what more the president yeah brian go ahead q right in addition to the jobs you talked about national security and that s one thing i think a lot of americans the president yeah q at home don t understand explain the national security aspect of this the president well without the chips and semiconductors nothing runs today you can t buy a car without them you can t get a radio a television nothing you can t get anything and we thought it was very important obviously business was but we thought even to terms of national security to have this large percentage of the chips semiconductors and other things that they make the most important product and not a product that you can really copy it takes years and years you re on the needle of a pin is total genius i mean they can put things i mean something the size of the needle the point of a pin they put information that is just not even believable so if you would cross talk if you would see this it s just really something yes brian q can i one one more aspect to that honda the president yeah q announced they re coming to indiana because of the tariffs once again the president that s right q you re bringing additional jobs in manufacturing do you want to comment on that as well the president well honda is coming and i told you about apple that they re going to be starting to build massively here $ billion and we have many other companies it s going to be announced but we had many that have already announced and no it s going to be great it s looking it s looking really strong i don t think this country has ever seen anything like we re seeing right now now the tariffs as you know it will start a week earlier than the reciprocal which is going to be on a couple of weeks earlier reciprocal tariffs start on april nd and i wanted to make it april st but i didn t want to do i didn t want to go april fool s day laughter because that cost me that costs a lot of money but that one day so we re going april nd but very importantly tomorrow tariffs percent on canada and percent on mexico and that ll start so they re going to have to have a tariff so what they ll have to do is build their car plants frankly and other things in the united states in which case they have no tariffs in other words you build and this is exactly what mr wei is doing by building here otherwise they ll build if they did them in taiwan to send them here they ll have percent or percent or percent or whatever the number may be someday it ll go only up but by doing it here he has no tariffs so he s way ahead of the game and i would just say this to people in canada or mexico if they re going to build car plants the people that are doing them are much better off building here because we have the market we re the market where they sell the most and so i think it s going to be very exciting very exciting for the automobile companies very exciting for i can think of any as an example north carolina they had the great i used to go there to buy furniture for hotels and it s been wiped out that business all went to other countries and now it s all going to come back into north carolina the furniture manufacturing business please q mr president q is the ukraine minerals deal now dead or can it be revived what what s your the president well i ll let you know we re making a speech you probably heard about it tomorrow night so i ll let you know tomorrow night but no i don t think so i think it s look it s a great deal for us because you know biden very very foolishly stupidly frankly gave $ billion and $ billion more accurately to a country to fight and to try and do things and you know what happened we get nothing we get nothing just gave it we could have rebuilt our entire u s navy with $ billion think of it three hundred and fifty billion we could have rebuilt our u s navy so he gave it away as fast as the money could be gone and what we re doing is getting that all back and a lot more than that and what we need it s very important for this business that we re talking about here with chips and semiconductors and everything else we need rare earths and the deal we have is we have the finest rare earths that you can q sir on ukraine sir on ukraine q are you going to press back q thank you mr president what do you need to see from president zelenskyy to restart these negotiations the president well i just think he should be more appreciative because this country has stuck with them through thick and thin we ve given them much more than europe and europe should have given more than us because as you know that s right there that s the border this country really was like the fence on the border it was very important to europe and i m not knocking europe i m saying they re just they were a lot smarter than joe biden because joe biden didn t have a clue he just gave money hand over a fist and they should have been able to equalize with us in other words if we gave a dollar they should have given well we gave $ billion they probably gave but on top of it all they get their money back because they are doing it in the form of a loan and it s a secured loan so when i saw that which i ve known about for a little while i said it s time for us to be smart at the same time it s great for them because they get us in the country taking the rare earth which is going to fuel this big engine and especially the engine that we ve in a very short time created and we get something and we re in the we re there we have a presence there with all of that being said i want one thing to happen i want all of those young people to stop being killed they re being killed by the thousands every single week last week were killed twenty seven hundred young in this case just about all young boys from ukraine and from russia and that s not young people from the united states but it s on a human basis i want to see it stop the money is one thing but the death and they re losing thousands of soldiers a week and that s not including the people that get killed every time a town goes down or a missile goes into a town cross talk we and and i want to see it stop yes q mr president are you considering canceling military aid to ukraine and can we get a reaction to what the kremlin just said that your administration is bringing u s worldview in alignment with moscow s the president so this is a deal that should have never happened this is a deal that would have never happened and it didn t happen for four years it didn t happen it was never even close to happening if i were president would not have happened and october th would have would not have happened in israel and inflation wouldn t have happened and afghanistan disastrous the way they withdrew not the fact that they withdrew but the way they withdrew would have never happened and we would have had bagram right now instead of china having it it was one hour away from where china makes their nuclear weapons we would have kept bagram one of the biggest air bases in the world all of these things happened and it s a shame but it is what it is and now we re here i want to see it end fast i don t want to see this go on for years and years now president zelenskyy supposedly made a statement today in ap i m not a big fan of ap so maybe it was an incorrect statement but he said he thinks the war is going to go on for a long time and he better not be right about that that s all i ll say q mr president is there any q could this project could this minimize the impact of the u s with chips should china decide to isolate taiwan or china decide to take taiwan the president well it s a very interesting point it s a great question actually but this would certainly i can t say minimize that would be a catastrophic event obviously but it will at least give us a position where we have in this very very important business we would have a very big part of it in the united states so it would have a big impact if something should happen with taiwan q and with russia sanctions are you looking at relieving russian sanctions if there is a peace deal the president well we re going to make deals with everybody to get this war including europe and european nations and they ve acted very well you know they re good people i know most of them are friends of mine the heads of state the heads of the various countries prime ministers from the different i got four prime ministers and five presidents called me over the last two days and they want to work it out they want to get it worked out and i think they re also you know they re talking money but the money is less important than the deaths we re talking

low and they re getting older they re recruiting older people it s a very very sad thing that s happening over there and we want to get it finished we want to stop the death cross talk q mr president on the tariffs is there any room left for canada and mexico to make a deal before midnight and should we expect those chinese tariffs the extra percent to take effect tomorrow the president no room left for mexico or for canada no the tariffs you know they re all set they go into effect tomorrow q mr president just a follow up on my colleague s question hearing the president and just so you understand vast amounts of fentanyl have poured into our country from mexico and as you know also from china where it goes to mexico and goes to canada and china also had an additional so it s plus and it comes in from canada and it comes in from mexico and that s a very important thing to say yeah please go ahead q have you decided if you re going to suspend military aid to ukraine have you made that decision the president well i haven t even talked about that right now i mean right now we ll see what happens a lot of things are happening right now as we speak i mean literally as we speak i could give you an answer and go back to my office the beautiful oval office i could go back into the oval office and find out that the answer is obsolete it s like his business it s obsolete you come up with a new chip and it s obsolete about two minutes later right but that s what s good about his business that s why he s the only one that s successful in it but q and on tariffs sir q mr president just to follow up my colleague s question from russia is saying that your foreign policy is largely in line with their vision should that be concerning to americans the president said what q should that be concerning to americans the president read the statement q that russia russia says that your administration s foreign policy is quote largely in line with their vision the president well i tell you what i think it takes two to tango and you re going to have to make a deal with russia and you re going to have to make a deal with ukraine you re going to have to have the ascent and

they ve suffered more than anybody else we talk about suffering they ve suffered but if you think about it under president bush they got georgia right russia got georgia under president obama they got a nice big submarine base a nice big chunk of land where they have their submarines you know that right crimea under president trump they got nothing and under president o biden they tried to get the whole thing they tried to get the whole big ukraine the whole thing if i didn t get in here they would ve gotten the whole thing so i can only say you can go back to bush you go back to obama and go back to biden they took a lot the only one they didn t get you know what i gave them i gave them anti tank missiles that s what i gave them i gave them sanctions on russia on russia i gave them javelins you know the javelins you know when they took out all those tanks you know the tanks were heading to kyiv by the hundreds and they were unstoppable and i gave them javelins so you know i really putin is the one that will tell you this has not been so good for them the fact is that i just want fairness i want fairness but think of it i gave russia nothing except grief i gave them nothing i gave them sanctions and javelins that s what i gave them obama gave them sheets and you heard that statement before it s a very famous trump gave them javelins and obama gave them sheets and then they say how close i am to russia let me tell you we have to make a deal because there are a lot of people being killed that shouldn t be killed but remember trump gave them nothing and the other presidents gave them a lot they gave them everything q mr president on trade you met with president argentine president javier milei at cpac he wants to sign a free trade agreement the president right q with the united states is that something that you would consider even with argentina or any other country the president i ll consider anything and argentina i think he s great by the way i think he s a great leader he s doing a great job he s doing a fantastic job brought it back from oblivion yeah we ll look at things we re looking at the uk with things it doesn t have to be tariffs but tariffs are easy they re fast they re efficient and they bring fairness for instance when people kill their dollar their equivalent of the dollar whatever whether it s the yuan or the yen in japan or the yuan in china when they drop them down that gives us that puts us at a very unfair disadvantage so all i have to do is say howard we re going to have to raise the tariffs a little bit because i ve called president xi i ve called the leaders of japan to say you can t continue to reduce and break down your currency you can t do it because it s unfair to us it s very hard for us to make tractors caterpillar here when japan china and other places are killing their currency meaning driving it down so all of these things add up and the way you solve it very easily is with tariffs because when they do that instead of having to make phone calls every day like i used to do with certain leaders president xi a little bit a lot of phone calls talking about the fact that they re lowering their yuan they re lowering it down and that makes it very very hard for us so this way i just say look let them do that and we make up for it with the tariffs but q will you be speaking with mexican president claudia sheinbaum about tariffs today the president yeah sure i will i have a lot of respect for her i have a lot of respect for her cross talk q after the percent tariff take ef the president yeah q takes effect it ll be percent on china now how high are you willing to go against china the president well i can t say it depends on what they do with their currency it depends on what they do in terms of a retaliation with some kind of an economic retaliation which i don t think they re going to retaliate too much hey look the united states has been taken advantage of for years the united states has been a laughing stock for years and years that s why this gentleman has built in taiwan instead of building here it would have been better if he built here if we had a president that knew what they were doing and we had a lot of them very bad on trade look i m a huge fan of ronald reagan but he was bad on trade very bad on trade he allowed a lot of people a lot of businesses to be taken so i say that with due respect because i he was so great on other things but he was bad on trade we are setting records right now records like nobody has ever seen before when you have companies like this coming in and almost percent of their company in one signature is going to be devoted to what he does which is one of the most important important businesses in the world that s an unbelievable thing when apple now is going to start building all of their plants here all because of what we ve done in terms of it s not because he likes me or they like me they don t probably like me at all i don t know i think he likes me a little bit at least laughter mr wei no i like you the president but you know what it s the incentive we ve created or the negative incentive i mean it s going to be very costly for people to take advantage of this country they can t come in and steal our money and steal our jobs and take our factories and take our businesses and expect not to be punished and they re being punished by tariffs it s a very powerful weapon that politicians haven t used because they were either dishonest stupid or paid off in some other form and now we re using them q have you spoken with president xi q agriculture the president say it q have you spoken with president xi about this this term the president i don t want to tell you that q on those incentives sir the president thank you very much everybody cross talk thank you thank you very much na

EST      MS. LEAVITT:  Hello.  Good afternoon, everybody.  I brought some heavy hitters in here with me today.  Today marks one month of President Trump’s return to the Oval Office, and there is no denying this administration is off to a historic start.  The President has already signed 73 executive orders.  That is more than double the number signed by Joe Biden and more than quadruple the number signed by Barack Obama over the same period. These executive orders have ended burdensome regulations; sealed the border; unleashed our domestic energy sector; eliminated divisive DEI from our federal government; stopped the weaponization of government; cut waste, fraud, and abuse; reinstituted “America First” trade and foreign policies; and ultimately restored common sense.  The President also signed the Laken Riley Act into law, which ensures ICE will detain illegal aliens arrested or charged with theft or violence.  As of today, the Senate has already confirmed 18 Cabinet-level nominees, which is more than at this point under the Obama administration in 2009 and more than double the pace of the Biden administration in 2021.  And today, we expect Kash Patel to be confirmed as the next director of the FBI.  We are proud to announce that the president will host his first official Cabinet meeting here at the White House next Wednesday, February 26th.  In just four weeks, President Trump has already hosted the leaders of Israel, Japan, Jordan, and India.  And next Monday, the President will host France’s President, Emmanuel Macron, and on Thursday, the UK Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, will visit the White House as well.  As you all know, over the past month, the President has taken questions from the press — all of you — nearly every single day, sometimes on multiple different occasions in the same day, on any topic any of you wish to talk about.  President Trump set the tone on this approach immediately when he took more than 12 times the questions in his first few hours in office as Joe Biden did in his entire first week.  Yesterday, we hosted a local media row here at the White House with television and radio stations from across the country that reached up to 60 million viewers and listeners.  In our ongoing pursuit of transparency, on this one-month celebration, I am thrilled to bring three of my colleagues and our policy experts here at the White House to further recap this incredible first month of accomplishments in greater detail. We have Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller; the Director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett; and our National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz.  I will hand it over to them.  They will deliver brief remarks on the accomplishments of this administration in the first month, and then we will open it up to Q and A.  When we open up the Q and A portion, I do ask, for the sake of efficiency in this room, that you direct your question to the principal you seek an answer from.  And I will call on you in this room. But first I will let them roll through their remarks.  And first up, I’ll turn it over to Stephen Miller. MR. MILLER:  Thank you.  It’s great to be back. And I want to just thank you all for joining today our one-month celebration of the most historic opening to a presidency in American history.  No president comes close to what Donald Trump has achieved over just the last 30 days. He has packed eight years of transformative action restoring this nation, restoring our laws, restoring fairness, restoring economic opportunity, restoring national security in just one month.  No one in this country has ever seen anything like it.  And when you look at the consequentiality and the significance and the transformative nature of the actions he’s taking, it truly defies description.  For example, in just one area, this nation has been plagued and crippled by illegal discrimination: diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.  It strangled our economy.  It has undermined public safety.  It has made every aspect of life more difficult, more painful, and less safe.  He has ended all DEI across the federal government.  He has terminated all federal workers involved in promulgating these unlawful policies.  He has ended diversity, equity, and inclusion in all federal contracting.  He has restored merit as the cornerstone of all federal policy; restored the full, fair, impartial enforcement of our federal civil rights laws for the first time in generations; and he has cracked down on individuals across this government and nonprofits who have engaged in illegal racial discrimination against the American people.  This includes making clear to every educational institution in this country that ending diversity, equity, and inclusion, ending unlawful race discrimination is a precondition of receiving federal funds.  He has also saved women’s sports by ending the participation of men in women’s sports.  He has ended radical gender ideology across the entire federal government, and he’s pressured the private sector to also end and combat radical gender ideology.  He’s reestablished the scientific and biological truth that there are only two sexes in this country — male and female — that those are biologically based determinations.  They are not based and can never be based on gender identity.  That includes rooting out of the Department of Defense all DEI policies, all critical race theory, all gender madness, and once again having a military that is focused solely and exclusively on readiness, preparedness, and lethality. As I’m sure Kevin will talk about more, of course, he has undertaken a historic cost-cutting effort across the federal government, launching the first-ever Department of Government Efficiency, uncovering corruption on a scale that we never thought imaginable, terminating every single federal worker that we — that we have found to be engaged in the corruption and theft and the waste of taxpayer dollars, and already saving $50 billion in a single year, which over a 10-year period would be $500 billion.  Just think about how vast and enormous that sum is.  Of course, as you all know, he has renamed the Gulf of Mexico to its correct and proper name: the Gulf of America.  He has renamed Mount Denali into Mount McKinley, part of a historic effort to restore patriotism and national pride all across this land.  He has ended the weaponization of the federal government, restored the Department of Justice to its true mission of combating threats to this nation and keeping the American people safe.  He has ended all federal censorship of free speech.  This has been one of the greatest crises that has plagued this nation.  Years and years and years, the federal government violating the First Amendment to take away Americans’ right of free speech — President Trump has ended that.  And he has demanded that all federal workers, all law enforcement cease any effort to intimidate the rights of Americans or to police their speech.  He has also restored the death penalty at the Department of Justice, including for illegal aliens who commit murder, including for those who murder cops, and including for all of those who threaten Americans with heinous acts of violence.  The death penalty is back.  Law and order is back.  The streets are being made safe once again.  On the public health front, he has launched the nation’s first-ever commission — the MAHA Commission — Make America Healthy Again, following the historic confirmation of RFK Jr., to finally uncover the true root causes of the public health crisis in this country, the childhood disease epidemic in this country, the spiraling rates of pediatric cancer and devastating childhood sickness.  He has finally created a situation where the federal heal- — health agencies in this country will be focused on preventing disease, on keeping children from getting sick in the first place, not sentencing them to a lifetime in and out of hospitals, suffering needlessly, when we can find ways to prevent this epidemic of illness.  Then, of course, on homeland security.  Today, it is officially the law of the land at the conclusion of the congressional notification process that six Mexican cartels and two transnational gangs — Tren de Aragua, or TDA, and MS-13 — so eight organizations in total — are now formally designated as foreign terrorist organizations, which means that every single member of those organizations who operates on U.S. soil is now, as a legal matter, a terrorist, and they will be treated as terrorists.  This is a sea change in U.S. policy.  And this means the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security, along with the rest of U.S. law enforcement and the Department of Defense, are now operating in a legal reality where these cartels are recognized as terrorists, and there will be a whole-of-government effort to remove these terrorists from our soil and to degrade their ability to threaten or undermine any American security or sovereignty interests. Border crossings since the day he took office are down 95 percent.  I think it’s almost impossible to even describe the scale and scope of that achievement.  President Trump, within days of taking office, cut border crossings 95 percent.  And those few who have dared to cross are being either prosecuted or deported.  They’re either facing significant jail time for trafficking, smuggling, harboring, aiding, impeding, or they’re being immediately removed from our soil.  Either way, at the end of the process, they are going home.  He has reimplemented Remain in Mexico, and he has obtained historic cooperation from foreign countries all around the world in accepting their deportees back.  And he has used the United States military to fully seal the southern border with a historic deployment of both active duty and National Guard troops, resumed the building of infrastructure.  He has opened up Guantanamo Bay, and he’s using military aircraft to carry out deportations all across this country.  And ICE is joining with ATF, DEA, and FBI to carry out the largest deportation operation in American history.  The criminals are going home.  The border is sealed shut.  America is safe, sovereign, proud, and free.  We are a nation that everyone in the world understands all across this planet: You do not come here illegally.  You will not get in.  You will go to jail.  You will go home.  You will not succeed.  This is the biggest and most successful change in any area of law enforcement that this nation has ever seen, and he did it in under one month.  Thank you. MR. HASSETT:  Should I go? MS. LEAVITT:  Yes, yes. MR. HASSETT:  Well, thank you, Karoline.  Thank you, Stephen.  You know, one of the things that President Trump cares most about is job creation.  And it was about seven years ago I had the honor of joining you in this room for the first time, and it looks like we’ve created a lot more jobs in the last month.  Look at how many people are here.  I — my estimate is about 180 but — but I didn’t count.  So, thank you.  It’s really an honor to be back here.  I think that I just want to go over a few things and then hand it off to Mike.  The first thing is that the President has told us to prioritize fighting inflation, and he had to do that because, as you know, President Biden let inflation get completely out of control.  And he did it with policies that made no sense.  They made no sense.  You know, a lot of times, you people say to us — our friends, the journalists — you know, “Why are you doing that?”  But — but, you know, I like to think, “Why did they do that?  Why did they spend so much money and then — why did the Fed print so much money so that we had inflation as high as we’ve ever seen since Jimmy Carter?  So, why did they do that?” So, we’re addressing inflation.  We didn’t have to address it in the first term, because it was always in the 1s, almost always.  But we’re going to get it back there.  And how are we doing it?  Well, we’re doing it with a plan that President Trump and I and others have talked about in the Oval that involves, like, every level of fighting inflation.  First, the macroeconomic level.  We’re cutting spending.  We’re cutting spending in negotiations with people on the Hill.  We’re cutting spending with the advice of our IT consultant, Elon Musk.  And then we’re also looking into supply-side things, like restoring Trump’s tax cuts, maybe even expensing new factories so that there is an explosion of supply.  If you have an explosion of supply and a reduction in government demand, then inflation goes way down.  And then, one of the things that you want to say is “Well, when are you going to see it?”  Well, the first thing that you’ll see when the markets believe that we’re going to get inflation under control is that the 10-year Treasury rate goes down, because that’s how they think about future expected inflation.  And so, we’re still going to see some memory of Biden’s inflation.  It’s not going to go away in a month.  But the 10-year Treasury before the last Consumer Price Index had dropped about 40 basis points.  Forty basis points because markets were optimistic about our ability to fight inflation.  Forty basis points is kind of not a fun thing to say.  I — economists talk that way.  I apologize.  But the way to think about it is, for a typical mortgage, if that affects the mortgage rate, then it’s going to save a typical family buying a house about a thousand bucks a year, and that’s just in our first month.  Okay.  The second thing we’ve done is we’ve had a lot of trade talks.  In fact, I was just meeting a minister from Mexico with Howard Lutnick just a couple of hours ago.  And we’re talking about reciprocal trade, and we’re also talking about the fentanyl crisis.  And so, reciprocal trade is about our government treating other governments the way they treat us.  We want trade to be fair.  It turns out that Americans have been disadvantaged by foreign governments over and over, and President Trump wants it to stop.  And the fact that struck me as most noticeable, when I started to look at what President Trump was asking us to do, is that last year — last year — we have data — U.S. companies paid $370 billion in taxes to foreign governments — $370 billion.  Last year, foreign multinationals paid us $57 billion in taxes.  We have one quarter of world GDP.  They have three quarters of world GDP.  And we’re paying $370.  They’re paying $57.  This is not reciprocal.  We’re going to try — or we’re going to fix it.  The other thing that we’ve done is we’ve had an all-of-the-above energy approach that’s led by Doug Burgum and Chris and a really large team — EPA — and we’ve already made so many actions that are going to affect the price of energy and lower inflation.  We’ve opened up 625 million acres to energy exploration.  We’ve cut 50 years of red tape that makes it so you can’t have permits.  And we’ve even made it so that when you go home, if you get a new one, then you can take a shower or flush a toilet or read under a light bulb.  We’re doing that too.  So — so, finally, let’s just think about, like, the facts that we can see right now that we think are awesome.  So, guess what?  Small-business optimism is — has go- — gone up by the most ever since President Trump came in.  ISM, which is the measure of what’s going on in manufacturing, it’s expanding again for the first time in years.  CEO confidence is the highest it’s been in years.  And the reason — the reason people are thinking this is that our policies give people cause for optimism.  And then I want to reiterate what Stephen Miller said, because it’s so important — and it’s so important for financial markets to start to digest this — that if, say, the Treasury secretary or the — any Cabinet secretary, with Elon Musk, is able to find some savings — say, $100 billion — well, in CBO land, that’s actually, like, about 10 times that or maybe 12 times that over a 10-year window.  And so, when you’re thinking about the negotiations right now over reconciliation and thinking about, well, $4 trillion, $5 trillion, well, those numbers, in terms of the savings, are going to end up being small because of all the waste that we’re finding.  And so, we’re incredibly optimistic about the future of inflation and the future of our economy.  And we’re optimistic because we’re making so much progress so far, and we already see it in market prices.  And, with that, I’ll hand it off to Mike.  MR. WALTZ:  All right.  Thanks, Kevin.  Well, good afternoon.  What a month and what a sea change in our — in our foreign policy.  In addition to what we’re doing on the border and restoring American sovereignty, in addition to what we’re doing in our economy and the job creation and the inflation reduction, we are bringing the world back to where it was at the end of President Trump’s first term, which is a world of peace, prosperity, and — and looking forward and getting us out of the chaos that we’ve just seen over the last four years.  So, over the last month, just to name a few, I had the honor of sitting in the Oval Office as President Trump spoke with President Putin and then immediately spoke with President Zelenskyy, and both of them said only President Trump could bring both sides to the table, and only President Trump could stop the horrific fighting that has been going on now for the better part of four years and that only President Trump could drive the world back to peace.  Both of those leaders said that in back-to-back calls. And, of course, we just had our historic talks mediated by our — our good friends and partners, Saudi Arabia — we give great thanks to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for hosting — and sat down for the first time in years with the Russians and talked about a path forward with peace. On top of that and one of the things that led to that was a tremendous co- — confidence-building measure that we had with the release of Marc Fogel.  I’ll remind everyone, the last time that we had an American released from the Russians, either we gave up a deadly spy; pressured our allies to give up a lethal killer; or we released, under the Biden administration, the world’s most notorious arms dealer, Viktor Bout, who, by the way, had one of his main clients for arms the cartels in — in Mexico and Central America.  We gave up none of that.  This was released as a confidence-building measure, working with our great Middle East Envoy, Steve Witkoff, and our secretary of State as a first step towards opening these talks and then moving forward towards peace.  On top of that, we’ve secured, just in a month, the return of a dozen — 12 — American hostages from Russia, from Bulgaria, from Venezuela, the Taliban, and Hamas.  Excuse me, that’s from Belarus, not Bulgaria.  We also had — for the first time in quite some time, we took out a senior leader of ISIS, an international financier and recruiter that the military had been trying to take out for quite some time and — and wasn’t able to do so, frankly, because of a bureaucratic approval process.  President Trump said, “Take him out.”  And that ISIS financier and leader is no longer on this Earth.  We’ve also taken action to eliminate other terrorist organizations in the Middle East.  We drove — before the President was even in office, he started talking consequences for people that would hold Americans.  Heretofore, there’s been nothing but upside.  You take an American, you get some better deal.  You take another one, maybe you get a better deal.  No more.  There is now nothing but downside for taking Americans illegally, either as hostages or illegal detainees.  And when President Trump sent a very clear message across the Middle East, but particularly to Hamas, that there would be all hell to pay, we suddenly saw a breakthrough.  And now we just saw the release of yet another group of hostages.  There have been dozens now, including two Americans that we’ve seen once again reunited with their families.  As part of the talks with King Abdullah, he offered — and — and I think the entire world has graciously accepted — to take 2,000 sick children, cancer patients, and others out of Gaza.  As a humanitarian — as a humanitarian gesture, 2,000 Gazans will come out of that hellhole that it is, that wasteland that Gaza is right now, with unexploded ordnance, with debris everywhere, with no sewage, with no water.  And — and President Trump has — has put forward a plan to deal with the practical reality that is 1.8 million Gazans now — now truly suffering. And then, you know, just to bring it back to our own hemisphere, we’ve seen literally, in the last month — after years of national security experts, the generals in charge, and others testifying and ringing the alarm bells about — about the Chinese Communist Party’s presence in our own hemisphere, particularly in the Panama Canal, we’re seeing the leadership of Panama step away from the Belt and Road program, move away from China and back towards the United States, and even enter into talks and — and other negotiations about addressing the ports on either side of the canal.  And then, finally, last but not least, we’ve had four world leaders in the White House, in the Oval Office.  We’ve had the prime minister of Japan, the prime minister of India, the king of — of Jordan, and, of course, the prime minister of Israel just in the last four weeks.  And next week, we’ll have the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and we’ll have the president of France, Macron.  So, President Trump is on what we call Trump warp speed.  We are all — we are all honored to be really serving under — under his leadership and his vision.  And truly, you know, when we all say — and the President himself say — says, he is a president of peace.  He is a president focused on restoring stability.  I think the entire world saw what the world would look like without strong American leadership in the last four years. And it’s truly been an honor to get us back to where we were and back on track under President Trump’s leadership.  MS. LEAVITT:  Thank you, Mike.  MR. WALTZ:  Mm-hmm. MS. LEAVITT:  Thank you.  Thank you, everybody.  I’m sure you’re very eager to ask questions of these very smart people working very hard on behalf of the president.  We do have somebody in our new media seat today.  We have John Stoll, who is the head of news at X.  As you all know — you’re all on X — it’s home to hundreds of millions of users, a large contingent of independent journalists and news organizations across geographies and political spectrums.  And at the same time, X remains the go-to platform for many legacy news outlets.  And I know, as I mentioned, many of the reporters in this room use X to attract eyeballs to your work.  Prior to joining X, John spent two decades in journalism, including several years as an editor at The Wall Street Journal.  We are excited to have him in the briefing room today. John, we’ll let you kick it off.  And as I said at the top, please direct your question to the individual up here who you’d like an answer from.  John, why don’t you begin. Q    All right.  Thank you very much.  I am sitting in for a thriving ecosystem of journalists, independent and — and emerging news organizations who do depend on X for publicity, for a business model.  And so, I look forward to seeing many of them in this seat in months and years to come.  I also thank you, Karoline, for opening this seat up to new media.  It — it really is a testament not only to your open-mindedness but also to innovation that you’d actually think about, you know, folks that are not traditionally credentialed to be in this room to be in this room and to not only have a question but also to witness — you know, this is at a very important intersection of power and the free press. And so, just the ability to witness this and — and be part of it, it brings everybody’s game up.  So, thank you for that.  I think this is for Mike Waltz.  My question is about Ukraine. MR. WALTZ:  Sure. Q    For about more than 10 years, I’ve been fascinated, like all — like many, with what’s going on.  I was in Northern Europe working out of the Baltics when Crimea was annexed and was — a lot — a lot of this came on Twitter.  The platform used to be known as Twitter.  Was — a lot of European leaders would — would talk about their disappointment and — and solidarity with Ukraine, but when it came to actually doing something, it felt like they were passing a hot potato and sent it over the Atlantic.  I wonder how much of what we’re seeing right now out of the administration and President Trump is a call to Europe and the European leaders and allies that we’ve traditionally had to pick up that hot potato and — and start doing something a little bit more concrete to win and preserve the peace in Ukraine.  The second question I have is — it — it’s related — is there’s been some — a lot of speculation that President Trump and the administration might be manipulated by Pre- — by Vladimir Putin.  I wonder if you can just talk a little bit about the administration’s posture — MR. WALTZ:  Yeah. Q    — and your confidence in the competence of this administration to d- — go toe to toe with Vladimir Putin.  MR. WALTZ:  Well, if there’s an- — I’ll take the l- — second question first.  If there’s anybody in this world that can go toe to toe with Putin, that could go toe to toe with Xi, that could go toe to toe with Kim Jong Un — and we could keep going down the list — it’s Donald J. Trump.  He is the dealmaker in chief.  There is no question that he is the commander in chief.  And I, for one — and I think all Americans and around the world should have no doubt about his ability to not only handle Putin but to handle the complexity of driving this war to an end.  And then on your first piece on Europe, I’ll take you back to 2014.  You’re right.  There was a lot of hand-wringing in Europe and not a lot of action.  There was also a lot of hand-wringing here in Washington under the Obama administration and not a lot of action.  They literally threw blankets at the problem.  And so, I’ll remind everyone that Putin had, you know, some type of conflict, invasion, or issue with their neighbor under President Bush, with Georgia; under President Obama, with Ukraine in 2014; not under President Trump, 45; and again with President Biden in 2022.  The war should have been deterred.  The war should have never happened, and I have no doubt it would not have happened under President Trump and will stop under President — President Trump again.  But I just want to push back on this notion of our European allies not being consulted as we’ve entered into this process.  I already mentioned the immediate phone call President Trump made to President Zelenskyy.  He has talked to President Macron of France repeatedly last week.  President Macron convened European leaders and then is coming here on Monday.  Prime Minister Starmer is coming next Thursday.  We’ve also — I’ve talked to every one of my national security — national security advisor counterparts across — across the spectrum in Europe.  I’ve talked to Secretary-General Rutte, the — the leader of NATO, the secretary-general of NATO.  We have repeatedly — oh, by the way, we had half our Cabinet — seven Cabinet officials, including the vice president, at the Munich Security Conference, all engaging, all listening, and all making sure our allies were heard.  However, we’ve also made it clear for years — decades, even — that it is unacceptable that the United States and the United States taxpayer continues to bear the burden not only of the cost of the war in Ukraine but of the defense of — of Europe.  We fully support our NATO Allies.  We fully support the Article 5 commitment.  But it’s time for our European allies to step up.  And one of the things that Secretary-General Rutte said on our call was this last couple of weeks have been a real wake-up call.  And I asked him, “What have you been missing the last couple of years?”  The fact that we are going to enter into a NATO summit this June with a third of our NATO Allies still not meeting the 2 percent minimum, a commitment they made a decade ago — literally a decade ago — with a war on their doorstep — the largest war that they’re all extremely concerned about — but yet it’s “Well, somebody else needs to pay.  We’ve got other domestic priorities.”  It’s unacceptable.  President Trump has made that clear.  And the minimum needs to be met.  We need to be at 100 percent in — this June at the NATO summit.  And then let’s talk about exceeding it, which what — is what President Trump has been talking about, with 5 percent of GDP.  Europe needs to step up for their own defense as a partner.  And we can be friends and allies and have those tough conversations.  MS. LEAVITT:  Great.  Peter. Q    Thank you, Karoline.  I have a Ukraine one and a DOGE one.  Who can talk DOGE? MS. LEAVITT:  Stephen, go ahead. Q    Well, so — so, Stephen, we’re hearing about these DOGE dividend checks that would be 20 percent back to taxpayers, 20 percent to pay down the debt.  Sixty percent is left.  Who gets that? MR. MILLER:  Well, the way that it works is when you achieve savings, you can either return it to taxpayers, you can return it to our debtors, or it can be cycled into next year’s budget, and then it just lowers the overall baseline for next year.  So, in other words, you can just transfer it into the next fiscal window and then lower the overall spending level.  And that means that you can achieve a permanent savings that way, and that reduces the deficit.  Q    And when is it that people might see those checks? MR. MILLER:  Well, this is all going to be worked on through the reconciliation process with Congress that’s going underway right now, as you’ve seen.  The Senate is moving a bill.  The House is moving a bill.  The president has great confidence in both chambers to deliver on his priorities.  I would just take this opportunity to note that President Trump has made a historic commitment to the working class of this country to fight for a major tax relief and major price relief.  And cutting spending, as DOGE is doing, and cutting taxes is the key to delivering on both of those promises.  And President Trump is resolutely committed to doing both.  Q    Thank you.  And on Ukraine.  I guess, this is for Mike. MR. WALTZ:  Sure.  Q    After the president’s post on Truth Social yesterday, need to know: Who does he think is more responsible for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Putin or Zelenskyy? MR. WALTZ:  Well, look, his — his goal, Peter, is to bring this war to an end, period.  And there has been ongoing fighting on both sides.  It is World War I-style trench warfare.  His frustration with President Zelenskyy is — that you’ve heard — is multifold.  One, there needs to be a deep appreciation for what the American people, what the American taxpayer, what President Trump did in — in his first term, and what we’ve done since.  So, some of the rhetoric coming out of Kyiv, frankly, and — and insults to President Trump were unacceptable.  Number one.  Number two, our own secretary of Treasury personally made the trip to offer the Ukrainians what is — can only be described as a historic opportunity — that is for America to coinvest with Ukraine in their minerals, in their resources, to truly grow the pie.  So, case in point, there’s a foundry that processes aluminum in Ukraine.  It’s — it’s been damaged.  It’s not at its current capacity.  If that is restored, it would account for America’s entire imports of aluminum for an entire year — that one foundry. There are tremendous resources there.  Not only is that long-term security for Ukraine, not only do we help them grow the pie with investments, but, you know, we do have an obligation to the American taxpayer in helping them recoup the hundreds of billions that ha- — that have occurred.  So, you know, rather than enter — enter into some constructive conversations about what that deal should be going forward, we got a lot of rhetoric in the media that was — that was incredibly unfortunate.  And I could just tell you, Peter, you know, as a veteran, as somebody who’s been in combat, this war is horrific.  And I think we’ve lost sight of that, of the literally thousands of people that are dying a day, families that are going without the next generation.  And I find it kind of, you know, frankly, ridiculous.  So many people in Washington that were just demanding, pounding the table for a ceasefire in Gaza are suddenly aghast that the president would demand one and both sides come to the table when it talks to — when it comes to Ukraine, a war that has been arguably far greater in — in scope and scale and far more dangerous in terms of global escalation to U.S. security. Q    And I do have one for Karoline. MS. LEAVITT:  Sure. Q    Does President Trump have a bet with Trudeau about this USA-Canada hockey game tonight?  (Laughter.)  And when there is a big hockey game on, is the president watching for the goals or for the fights? MS. LEAVITT:  (Laughs.)  Probably both.  I think he’s watching for the United States to win tonight.  I know he talked to the USA hockey team this morning.  He talked to the players after their morning practice, around 10 o’clock.  And I also spoke to some folks from that team after.  They were jubilant over President Trump’s comments to the team.  I believe they’re going to put out a video of that call.  So, he looks forward to watching the game tonight, and we look forward to the United States beating our soon-to-be 51st state, Canada.  (Laughter.) Bloomberg, go ahead.  Q    My question is for Mike Waltz.  Can you give us a readout of Kellogg’s meeting with Zelenskyy that just wrapped up?  And, in particular, Zelenskyy publicly rejected this deal about the rare earth minerals.  Where — where does that stand? MR. WALTZ:  Well, we’re going to continue to have — he needs to come back to the table, and we’re going to continue to have discussions about where that deal is going.  Again, we have an obligation to the taxpayer.  I think this is an opportunity.  The president thinks this is an opportunity for Ukraine going forward.  There can be, in my view, nothing better for Ukraine’s future and for their security than — than to have the United States invested in their prosperity long-term.  And then a key piece of this has also been security guarantees.  Look, the — the reality that we’re talking about here is: Is it in Ukraine’s interest?  Is it in Europe’s interest?  It certainly isn’t in Russia’s interest or in the American people’s interest for this war to grind on forever and ever and ever.  So, a key part of his conversation was helping President Zelenskyy understand this war needs to come to an end.  This kind of open-ended mantra that we’ve had under the Biden administration, that’s over.  And I think a lot of people are having a hard time accepting that. And then the other piece is there’s been discussions from Prime Minister Starmer and also President Macron about European-led security guarantees.  We welcome that.  We’ve been asking Europe to step up and secure its own prosperity, safety, and security.  So, we certainly welcome that.  And we certainly welcome more European assistance.  As I told my counterparts, “Come to the table with more, if — if you want a bigger seat at the table.”  And we’ve been asking for that for quite some time.  Q    And has Russia pushed for sanctions in your talks with them?  And have you consulted with international partners and allies about potentially rolling back sanctions in these negotiations to end the war? MR. WALTZ:  Those — the talks with — with our Russian counterparts — both with my counterpart, the national security advisor; Secretary Rubio’s counterpart, the Foreign Minister, Foreign Minister Lavrov — you know, it — it really were — was quite broad, focused on what is the goals for our broader relationship, but very clear that the fighting has to stop to get to any of those brighter goals.  And as a first step, we’re just going to do some commonsense things, like restore the — the ability of both of our embassies to function.  And, again, you know, this is — this was common sense.  In — in foreign policy world, they call it “shuttle diplomacy.”  We have to talk to both sides in order to get to both sides to the table, and both sides have said only President Trump could do that.  MS. LEAVITT:  Diana. Q    Thank you.  And my question is for Mike Waltz.  (Laughter.) MR. WALTZ:  All right. Q    The president has called Zelenskyy a dictator.  Does he view Putin as a dictator?  And does he want Zelenskyy out of power?  I know he’s called for elections.  And then, thirdly, the head of the Defense Committee in Ukraine’s parliament just has claimed that the U.S. has stopped selling weapons to Ukraine.  Is that true? MR. WALTZ:  Well, most of our weapons that have gone to Ukraine have been part of a drawdown authority, where we’ve literally taken them out of our stocks and then, eventually, through appropriations, started buying them again to refill our stocks.  I’ll, you know, just state that there has been a lag in a lot of that process.  So, many of our stocks, as we look at our operations around the world, are becoming more depleted.  That’s one of the reasons many people have had a lot of concern about: When does this end?  How much is it going to take?  How many lives will be lost?  How much will we be — how much will we spend?  As a member of Congress, we repeatedly asked the Biden administration those questions, and we never got a satisfactory answer.  Look, President Trump is obviously very frustrated right now with President Zelenskyy — the fact that — that he hasn’t come to the table, that he hasn’t been willing to take this opportunity that we have offered.  I think he eventually will get to that point, and I hope so very quickly. But President Trump is — as we made clear to our Russian counterparts, and I want to make clear today — he’s focused on stopping the fighting and moving forward.  And we could argue all day long about what’s happened in the past.  MS. LEAVITT:  Reagan. Q    Thanks.  I have a question for Stephen — (Cross-talk.) Q    — and a question for Mike. MS. LEAVITT:  Excuse me, I just called on Reagan.  Reagan, go ahead.  Q    I have a question for Stephen and a question for Mike.  MS. LEAVITT:  Sure. Q    Stephen, I can start with you.  There have been reports — MR. MILLER:  Thank you. Q    — that Trump is unhappy with the rate of deportations and he wants them to be higher.  Is the president happy with the rate of deportations, and are there any plans to speed up the process? MR. MILLER:  Well, first of all, we all appreciate the encouragement from the media to deport as many illegal aliens as humanly possible.  So, thank you.  And I will promise you that the full might of the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, and every element and instrument of national power will be used to remove, with speed, all criminal illegals from the soil of the United States of America, to enforce final removal orders, and to ensure that this country is for American citizens and those who legally belong in this country. We inherited an ICE that was completely shuttered.  We inherited a Department of Homeland Security whose sole mission was to resettle illegal aliens within the United States of America.  In 30 days, the president sealed the border shut, declared the cartels to be terrorist organizations, has increased ICE deportations to levels not seen in decades, and we are shortly on the verge of achieving a pace and speed of deportations this country has never before seen.  Thank you.  Q    And Mike. MR. WALTZ:  Mm-hmm. Q    There have been reports that there’s some underground opposition to Trump’s pick for Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, Elbridge Colby.  Have you or anyone from the administration been personally lobbying senators to support Elbridge Colby?  MR. WALTZ:  Look, I’ve worked with Bridge Co- — Colby in the past.  He has the president’s full support to be the Undersecretary of policy, which will be a critical policy arm for Secretary Hegseth going forward that will implement a lot of these policies.  And — and really, that’s — that’s been the extent of it.  I think there’s been a lot of kind of, you know, breathless — I don’t know — back-and-forth in the — in the press, but we’re full speed ahead to get the president’s team in place so we can implement his America First policy.  MS. LEAVITT:  Thank you.  Mike has spoken pretty extensively.  Does anybody have questions for Stephen or for Mr. Hassett? Q    I do. MS. LEAVITT:  Nobody wants to talk about the economy?  (Laughter.) (Cross-talk.) MS. LEAVITT:  Sure.  Q    IRS. MS. LEAVITT:  IRS.  Okay.  Go ahead. Q    And this would be for either one of you.  So, we have reported, several other outlets have reported that about 3,500 people are due to be — lose their jobs at the IRS by the end of the week.  If the goal of these spending cuts across the federal government has been to reduce the debt, why impose some of the deepest cuts we’ve seen so far at the agency responsible for raising revenue for the federal government? MR. HASSETT:  Well, I think our objective is to make sure that the employees that we pay are being productive and effective.  And there are many, many — more than 100,000 people working to collect taxes, and not all of them are fully occupied.  And the Treasury secretary is studying the matter and feels like 3,500 is a small number and probably can get bigger, especially as we improve the IT at the IRS. And so — so, I think that it’s absolutely something that is on the table for good reasons.  And the point is that — don’t just talk about the IRS.  Talk about all of government, that there are so many places — I live in D.C.; you maybe live in D.C. — where you never — there — nobody — nobody is going into the buildings.  People aren’t commuting because nobody is doing their job.  We look back and we see that there are all these people doing two jobs while they’re getting a government payroll — on the payroll.  So, the point is, we’re fixing that, and the IRS is a small part of that picture.  Q    So, you’re saying that everybody who’s being let go was doing a bad job?MR. HASSETT:  I’m saying that we’re studying every agency and deciding who to let go and why, and we’re doing so very rationally with a lot of support from analysis.  Q    Because we’re being told by a lot of people who have been let go at other agencies that they were told they were being dismissed because of poor performance, when, in some cases, they haven’t even had a performance review yet because they’ve only been on the job a couple of months.  MR. HASSETT:  Yeah, I’ve never seen a person who was laid off for poor performance say that they were performing poorly.  (Laughter.)  Okay?Q    Karoline. MS. LEAVITT:  Good point.  Sure, Kaitlan. Q    I have a question.  I’ll start with you, Kevin Hassett.  Thank you for being here.  And then I’ve got a question for Mr. Waltz. On these potential checks that you might send out from DOGE, is there a concern, as you’re thinking through this, that they could be inflationary? MR. HASSETT:  Oh, absolutely not, because imagine if we don’t spend government money and we give it back to people, then the — you know, if they spend it all, then you’re even.  But they’re probably going to save a lot of it, in which case, you’re reducing inflation.  Q    Okay.  So, you’re not — MR. HASSETT:  And also, when the government spends a lot, that’s what creates inflation.  We learned that from Joe Biden.  And so, if we reduce government spending, then that’s — you know, reduces inflation.  And if you give people money, then they’re going to save a bunch of it.  And — and when they save it, then that also reduces demand and reduces inflation.  Q    Okay.  So, you’re not worried about it.  MR. HASSETT:  No, I’m not. Q    And, Mr. Waltz, to follow up on Peter’s question, you wrote in an op-ed in the fall of 2023 that, quote, “Putin is to blame, certainly, like al Qaeda was to blame for 9/11.” MR. WALTZ:  Mm-hmm. Q    Do you still feel that way now, or do you share the president’s assessment, as he says Ukraine is to blame for the start of this war? MR. WALTZ:  Well, it shouldn’t surprise you that I share the president’s assessment on all kinds of issues.  What I wrote as a Member of Congress is — was as a former Member of Congress.  Look, what I share the president’s assessment on is that the war has to end.  And what comes with that?  What comes with that should be, at some point, elections.  What comes with that should be peace.  What comes with that is prosperity that we’ve just offered in this natural resources and economic partnership arrangement: an end to the killing and European security and security for the world.  The President is not only determined to do that in Europe, he’s determined to do it in the Middle East.  And just a few months ago, we had an administration that had tried for 15 months, week after week, sitting with you here, and couldn’t get us to a ceasefire, couldn’t get our hostages out.  Now we’re at that point.  We’re back to the maximum pressure on Iran. And we will — we have just begun, and we will drive towards a ceasefire and all of those other steps.  I’m not going to pre-negotiate or get ahead of the sequencing of all of that.  It’s a very delicate situation.  But this is a president of peace.  And who here would argue against peace? Q    Okay.  So, you do share that assessment.  And can I follow up.  In 2017 — MS. LEAVITT:  No.  Go ahead, Jordan. Q    — then-President Trump — MS. LEAVITT:  Go ahead, Jordan.  Q    Can I just follow up really quickly? Q    Thank you.  So — MS. LEAVITT:  You just had two questions, Kaitlan. Q    May I — can I just — MS. LEAVITT:  Jordan, go ahead.  Q    Mr. — Mr. Hassett — MS. LEAVITT:  Thank you. Q    I have an important follow-up for Mike Waltz. MS. LEAVITT:  Jordan, go ahead.  Go ahead. Q    So, Mr. Hassett, you were speaking about tariff revenue, and you also addressed a question about the R- — IRS.  President Trump has spoken about replacing income tax with tariff revenue, especially with all this waste, fraud, and abuse that we’re seeing cut.  Is that a possibility? MR. HASSETT:  Absolutely.  And, in fact, if you think about the China tariff revenue that we’re estimating is coming in from the 10 percent that we just added, plus the de minimis thing, that it’s between $500 billion and a trillion dollars over 10 years, is our estimate.  And that’s something that is outside of the reductions that markets are seeing through the negotiations up on the Hill. And so, we expect that the tariff revenue is actually going to make it much easier for Republicans to pass a bill, and that was the President’s plan all along.  Thank you. Q    And I — I have a question for Stephen Miller about DOGE.  So, you — you spoke about DOGE.  You said roughly $50 billion is set to be cut in a year of waste, fraud, and abuse by unelected bureaucrats.  We’re hearing this ironic narrative from the President’s critics and the left-wing media that Elon Musk is an unelected bureaucrat, and he’s doing all this terrible stuff.  Isn’t one of DOGE’s objectives to get — get rid of the federal bureaucracy, the — the deep state?  And also, who was running the White House when Joe Biden was in office — MR. MILLER:  (Laughs.) Q    — because I don’t know a single person who believes it was Joe Biden?  MR. MILLER:  Yes.  You’re — you’re tempting me to say — (laughs) — some very harsh things about some of our media friends.  The — yes, it is true that many of the people in this room, for four years, failed to cover the fact that Joe Biden was mentally incompetent and was not running the country.  It is also true that many people in this room who have used this talking point that Elon is not elected fail to understand how government works.  So, I’m glad for the opportunity for a brief civics lesson.  A president is elected by the whole American people.  He’s the only official in the entire government that is elected by the entire nation.  Right?  Judges are appointed.  Members of Congress are elected at the district or state level.  Just one man.  And the Constitution, Article Two, has a clause, known as the vesting clause, and it says, “The executive power shall be vested in a president,” singular.  The whole will of democracy is imbued into the elected president.  That president then appoints staff to then impose that democratic will onto the government.  The threat to democracy — indeed, the existential threat to democracy — is the unelected bureaucracy of lifetime, tenured civil servants who believe they answer to no one, who believe they can do whatever they want without consequence, who believe they can set their own agenda no matter what Americans vote for.  So, Americans vote for radical FBI reform, and FBI agents say they don’t want to change.  Or Americans vote for radical reform in our energy policies, but EPA bureaucrats say they don’t want to change.  Or Americans vote to end DEI — racist DEI policies, and lawyers in the Department of Justice say they don’t want to change.  What President Trump is doing is he is removing federal bureaucrats who are defying democracy by failing to implement his lawful orders, which are the will of the whole American people.  Thank you.  Q    Thanks, Stephen.  Can I follow up? Q    Karoline. MS. LEAVITT:  Thank you very much, everybody.  I’m looking at the clock.  We’ve almost had an hour of time.  (Cross-talk.)LEAVITT:  I know a couple of these individuals have a meeting to get to at 2:00 p.m.  So, you’re welcome to follow up with my team for further questions.  We’re going to let these guys get back to running the United States government. And we will see you all later.  President Trump will be speaking at 3 o’clock at the Black History Month reception. So, thank you.  It’s good to see you.  We’ll see you in a bit.  Thanks. Q    Are you going to the Black History Month reception, Mr. Miller? Q    Stephen, on the fraud.  Should we expect indictments? Q    What is your reaction to Mitch McConnell’s retirement? Q    Are there indictments coming for all the fraud we’ve found?      MR. MILLER:  I’d love to follow up with you.  Just set up a time with Karoline.      Q    Okay.  Thank you.  END                   1:56 P.M.

the sake of efficiency in this room that you direct your question to the principal you seek an answer from and i will call on you in this room but first i will let them roll through their remarks and first up i ll turn it over to stephen miller mr miller thank you it s great to be back and i want to just thank you all for joining today our one month celebration of the most historic opening to a presidency in american history no president comes close to what donald trump has achieved over just the last days he has packed eight years of transformative action restoring this nation restoring our laws restoring fairness restoring economic opportunity restoring national security in just one month no one in this country has ever seen anything like it and when you look at the consequentiality and the significance and the transformative nature of the actions he s taking it truly defies description for example in just one area this nation has been plagued and crippled by illegal discrimination diversity equity and inclusion policies it strangled our economy it has undermined public safety it has made every aspect of life more difficult more painful and less safe he has ended all dei across the federal government he has terminated all federal workers involved in promulgating these unlawful policies he has ended diversity equity and inclusion in all federal contracting he has restored merit as the cornerstone of all federal policy restored the full fair impartial enforcement of our federal civil rights laws for the first time in generations and he has cracked down on individuals across this government and nonprofits who have engaged in illegal racial discrimination against the american people this includes making clear to every educational institution in this country that ending diversity equity and inclusion ending unlawful race discrimination is a precondition of receiving federal funds he has also saved women s sports by ending the participation of men in women s sports he has ended radical gender ideology across the entire federal government and he s pressured the private sector to also end and combat radical gender ideology he s reestablished the scientific and biological truth that there are only two sexes in this country male and female that those are biologically based determinations they are not based and can never be based on gender identity that includes rooting out of the department of defense all dei policies all critical race theory all gender madness and once again having a military that is focused solely and exclusively on readiness preparedness and lethality as i m sure kevin will talk about more of course he has undertaken a historic cost cutting effort across the federal government launching the first ever department of government efficiency uncovering corruption on a scale that we never thought imaginable terminating every single federal worker that we that we have found to be engaged in the corruption and theft and the waste of taxpayer dollars and already saving $ billion in a single year which over a year period would be $ billion just think about how vast and enormous that sum is of course as you all know he has renamed the gulf of mexico to its correct and proper name the gulf of america he has renamed mount denali into mount mckinley part of a historic effort to restore patriotism and national pride all across this land he has ended the weaponization of the federal government restored the department of justice to its true mission of combating threats to this nation and keeping the american people safe he has ended all federal censorship of free speech this has been one of the greatest crises that has plagued this nation years and years and years the federal government violating the first amendment to take away americans right of free speech president trump has ended that and he has demanded that all federal workers all law enforcement cease any effort to intimidate the rights of americans or to police their speech he has also restored the death penalty at the department of justice including for illegal aliens who commit murder including for those who murder cops and including for all of those who threaten americans with heinous acts of violence the death penalty is back law and order is back the streets are being made safe once again on the public health front he has launched the nation s first ever commission the maha commission make america healthy again following the historic confirmation of rfk jr to finally uncover the true root causes of the public health crisis in this country the childhood disease epidemic in this country the spiraling rates of pediatric cancer and devastating childhood sickness he has finally created a situation where the federal heal health agencies in this country will be focused on preventing disease on keeping children from getting sick in the first place not sentencing them to a lifetime in and out of hospitals suffering needlessly when we can find ways to prevent this epidemic of illness then of course on homeland security today it is officially the law of the land at the conclusion of the congressional notification process that six mexican cartels and two transnational gangs tren de aragua or tda and ms so eight organizations in total are now formally designated as foreign terrorist organizations which means that every single member of those organizations who operates on u s soil is now as a legal matter a terrorist and they will be treated as terrorists this is a sea change in u s policy and this means the department of justice and the department of homeland security along with the rest of u s law enforcement and the department of defense are now operating in a legal reality where these cartels are recognized as terrorists and there will be a whole of government effort to remove these terrorists from our soil and to degrade their ability to threaten or undermine any american security or sovereignty interests border crossings since the day he took office are down percent i think it s almost impossible to even describe the scale and scope of that achievement president trump within days of taking office cut border crossings percent and those few who have dared to cross are being either prosecuted or deported they re either facing significant jail time for trafficking smuggling harboring aiding impeding or they re being immediately removed from our soil either way at the end of the process they are going home he has reimplemented remain in mexico and he has obtained historic cooperation from foreign countries all around the world in accepting their deportees back and he has used the united states military to fully seal the southern border with a historic deployment of both active duty and national guard troops resumed the building of infrastructure he has opened up guantanamo bay and he s using military aircraft to carry out deportations all across this country and ice is joining with atf dea and fbi to carry out the largest deportation operation in american history the criminals are going home the border is sealed shut america is safe sovereign proud and free we are a nation that everyone in the world understands all across this planet you do not come here illegally you will not get in you will go to jail you will go home you will not succeed this is the biggest and most successful change in any area of law enforcement that this nation has ever seen and he did it in under one month thank you mr hassett should i go ms leavitt yes yes mr hassett well thank you karoline thank you stephen you know one of the things that president trump cares most about is job creation and it was about seven years ago i had the honor of joining you in this room for the first time and it looks like we ve created a lot more jobs in the last month look at how many people are here i my estimate is about but but i didn t count so thank you it s really an honor to be back here i think that i just want to go over a few things and then hand it off to mike the first thing is that the president has told us to prioritize fighting inflation and he had to do that because as you know president biden let inflation get completely out of control and he did it with policies that made no sense they made no sense you know a lot of times you people say to us our friends the journalists you know why are you doing that but but you know i like to think why did they do that why did they spend so much money and then why did the fed print so much money so that we had inflation as high as we ve ever seen since jimmy carter so why did they do that so we re addressing inflation we didn t have to address it in the first term because it was always in the s almost always but we re going to get it back there and how are we doing it well we re doing it with a plan that president trump and i and others have talked about in the oval that involves like every level of fighting inflation first the macroeconomic level we re cutting spending we re cutting spending in negotiations with people on the hill we re cutting spending with the advice of our it consultant elon musk and then we re also looking into supply side things like restoring trump s tax cuts maybe even expensing new factories so that there is an explosion of supply if you have an explosion of supply and a reduction in government demand then inflation goes way down and then one of the things that you want to say is well when are you going to see it well the first thing that you ll see when the markets believe that we re going to get inflation under control is that the year treasury rate goes down because that s how they think about future expected inflation and so we re still going to see some memory of biden s inflation it s not going to go away in a month but the year treasury before the last consumer price index had dropped about basis points forty basis points because markets were optimistic about our ability to fight inflation forty basis points is kind of not a fun thing to say i economists talk that way i apologize but the way to think about it is for a typical mortgage if that affects the mortgage rate then it s going to save a typical family buying a house about a thousand bucks a year and that s just in our first month okay the second thing we ve done is we ve had a lot of trade talks in fact i was just meeting a minister from mexico with howard lutnick just a couple of hours ago and we re talking about reciprocal trade and we re also talking about the fentanyl crisis and so reciprocal trade is about our government treating other governments the way they treat us we want trade to be fair it turns out that americans have been disadvantaged by foreign governments over and over and president trump wants it to stop and the fact that struck me as most noticeable when i started to look at what president trump was asking us to do is that last year last year we have data u s companies paid $ billion in taxes to foreign governments $ billion last year foreign multinationals paid us $ billion in taxes we have one quarter of world gdp they have three quarters of world gdp and we re paying $ they re paying $ this is not reciprocal we re going to try or we re going to fix it the other thing that we ve done is we ve had an all of the above energy approach that s led by doug burgum and chris and a really large team epa and we ve already made so many actions that are going to affect the price of energy and lower inflation we ve opened up million acres to energy exploration we ve cut years of red tape that makes it so you can t have permits and we ve even made it so that when you go home if you get a new one then you can take a shower or flush a toilet or read under a light bulb we re doing that too so so finally let s just think about like the facts that we can see right now that we think are awesome so guess what small business optimism is has go gone up by the most ever since president trump came in ism which is the measure of what s going on in manufacturing it s expanding again for the first time in years ceo confidence is the highest it s been in years and the reason the reason people are thinking this is that our policies give people cause for optimism and then i want to reiterate what stephen miller said because it s so important and it s so important for financial markets to start to digest this that if say the treasury secretary or the any cabinet secretary with elon musk is able to find some savings say $ billion well in cbo land that s actually like about times that or maybe times that over a year window and so when you re thinking about the negotiations right now over reconciliation and thinking about well $ trillion $ trillion well those numbers in terms of the savings are going to end up being small because of all the waste that we re finding and so we re incredibly optimistic about the future of inflation and the future of our economy and we re optimistic because we re making so much progress so far and we already see it in market prices and with that i ll hand it off to mike mr waltz all right thanks kevin well good afternoon what a month and what a sea change in our in our foreign policy in addition to what we re doing on the border and restoring american sovereignty in addition to what we re doing in our economy and the job creation and the inflation reduction we are bringing the world back to where it was at the end of president trump s first term which is a world of peace prosperity and and looking forward and getting us out of the chaos that we ve just seen over the last four years so over the last month just to name a few i had the honor of sitting in the oval office as president trump spoke with president putin and then immediately spoke with president zelenskyy and both of them said only president trump could bring both sides to the table and only president trump could stop the horrific fighting that has been going on now for the better part of four years and that only president trump could drive the world back to peace both of those leaders said that in back to back calls and of course we just had our historic talks mediated by our our good friends and partners saudi arabia we give great thanks to crown prince mohammed bin salman for hosting and sat down for the first time in years with the russians and talked about a path forward with peace on top of that and one of the things that led to that was a tremendous co confidence building measure that we had with the release of marc fogel i ll remind everyone the last time that we had an american released from the russians either we gave up a deadly spy pressured our allies to give up a lethal killer or we released under the biden administration the world s most notorious arms dealer viktor bout who by the way had one of his main clients for arms the cartels in in mexico and central america we gave up none of that this was released as a confidence building measure working with our great middle east envoy steve witkoff and our secretary of state as a first step towards opening these talks and then moving forward towards peace on top of that we ve secured just in a month the return of a dozen american hostages from russia from bulgaria from venezuela the taliban and hamas excuse me that s from belarus not bulgaria we also had for the first time in quite some time we took out a senior leader of isis an international financier and recruiter that the military had been trying to take out for quite some time and and wasn t able to do so frankly because of a bureaucratic approval process president trump said take him out and that isis financier and leader is no longer on this earth we ve also taken action to eliminate other terrorist organizations in the middle east we drove before the president was even in office he started talking consequences for people that would hold americans heretofore there s been nothing but upside you take an american you get some better deal you take another one maybe you get a better deal no more there is now nothing but downside for taking americans illegally either as hostages or illegal detainees and when president trump sent a very clear message across the middle east but particularly to hamas that there would be all hell to pay we suddenly saw a breakthrough and now we just saw the release of yet another group of hostages there have been dozens now including two americans that we ve seen once again reunited with their families as part of the talks with king abdullah he offered and and i think the entire world has graciously accepted to take sick children cancer patients and others out of gaza as a humanitarian as a humanitarian gesture gazans will come out of that hellhole that it is that wasteland that gaza is right now with unexploded ordnance with debris everywhere with no sewage with no water and and president trump has has put forward a plan to deal with the practical reality that is million gazans now now truly suffering and then you know just to bring it back to our own hemisphere we ve seen literally in the last month after years of national security experts the generals in charge and others testifying and ringing the alarm bells about about the chinese communist party s presence in our own hemisphere particularly in the panama canal we re seeing the leadership of panama step away from the belt and road program move away from china and back towards the united states and even enter into talks and and other negotiations about addressing the ports on either side of the canal and then finally last but not least we ve had four world leaders in the white house in the oval office we ve had the prime minister of japan the prime minister of india the king of of jordan and of course the prime minister of israel just in the last four weeks and next week we ll have the prime minister of the united kingdom and we ll have the president of france macron so president trump is on what we call trump warp speed we are all we are all honored to be really serving under under his leadership and his vision and truly you know when we all say and the president himself say says he is a president of peace he is a president focused on restoring stability i think the entire world saw what the world would look like without strong american leadership in the last four years and it s truly been an honor to get us back to where we were and back on track under president trump s leadership ms leavitt thank you mike mr waltz mm hmm ms leavitt thank you thank you everybody i m sure you re very eager to ask questions of these very smart people working very hard on behalf of the president we do have somebody in our new media seat today we have john stoll who is the head of news at x as you all know you re all on x it s home to hundreds of millions of users a large contingent of independent journalists and news organizations across geographies and political spectrums and at the same time x remains the go to platform for many legacy news outlets and i know as i mentioned many of the reporters in this room use x to attract eyeballs to your work prior to joining x john spent two decades in journalism including several years as an editor at the wall street journal we are excited to have him in the briefing room today john we ll let you kick it off and as i said at the top please direct your question to the individual up here who you d like an answer from john why don t you begin q all right thank you very much i am sitting in for a thriving ecosystem of journalists independent and and emerging news organizations who do depend on x for publicity for a business model and so i look forward to seeing many of them in this seat in months and years to come i also thank you karoline for opening this seat up to new media it it really is a testament not only to your open mindedness but also to innovation that you d actually think about you know folks that are not traditionally credentialed to be in this room to be in this room and to not only have a question but also to witness you know this is at a very important intersection of power and the free press and so just the ability to witness this and and be part of it it brings everybody s game up so thank you for that i think this is for mike waltz my question is about ukraine mr waltz sure q for about more than years i ve been fascinated like all like many with what s going on i was in northern europe working out of the baltics when crimea was annexed and was a lot a lot of this came on twitter the platform used to be known as twitter was a lot of european leaders would would talk about their disappointment and and solidarity with ukraine but when it came to actually doing something it felt like they were passing a hot potato and sent it over the atlantic i wonder how much of what we re seeing right now out of the administration and president trump is a call to europe and the european leaders and allies that we ve traditionally had to pick up that hot potato and and start doing something a little bit more concrete to win and preserve the peace in ukraine the second question i have is it it s related is there s been some a lot of speculation that president trump and the administration might be manipulated by pre by vladimir putin i wonder if you can just talk a little bit about the administration s posture mr waltz yeah q and your confidence in the competence of this administration to d go toe to toe with vladimir putin mr waltz well if there s an i ll take the l second question first if there s anybody in this world that can go toe to toe with putin that could go toe to toe with xi that could go toe to toe with kim jong un and we could keep going down the list it s donald j trump he is the dealmaker in chief there is no question that he is the commander in chief and i for one and i think all americans and around the world should have no doubt about his ability to not only handle putin but to handle the complexity of driving this war to an end and then on your first piece on europe i ll take you back to you re right there was a lot of hand wringing in europe and not a lot of action there was also a lot of hand wringing here in washington under the obama administration and not a lot of action they literally threw blankets at the problem and so i ll remind everyone that putin had you know some type of conflict invasion or issue with their neighbor under president bush with georgia under president obama with ukraine in not under president trump and again with president biden in the war should have been deterred the war should have never happened and i have no doubt it would not have happened under president trump and will stop under president president trump again but i just want to push back on this notion of our european allies not being consulted as we ve entered into this process i already mentioned the immediate phone call president trump made to president zelenskyy he has talked to president macron of france repeatedly last week president macron convened european leaders and then is coming here on monday prime minister starmer is coming next thursday we ve also i ve talked to every one of my national security national security advisor counterparts across across the spectrum in europe i ve talked to secretary general rutte the the leader of nato the secretary general of nato we have repeatedly oh by the way we had half our cabinet seven cabinet officials including the vice president at the munich security conference all engaging all listening and all making sure our allies were heard however we ve also made it clear for years decades even that it is unacceptable that the united states and the united states taxpayer continues to bear the burden not only of the cost of the war in ukraine but of the defense of of europe we fully support our nato allies we fully support the article commitment but it s time for our european allies to step up and one of the things that secretary general rutte said on our call was this last couple of weeks have been a real wake up call and i asked him what have you been missing the last couple of years the fact that we are going to enter into a nato summit this june with a third of our nato allies still not meeting the percent minimum a commitment they made a decade ago literally a decade ago with a war on their doorstep the largest war that they re all extremely concerned about but yet it s well somebody else needs to pay we ve got other domestic priorities it s unacceptable president trump has made that clear and the minimum needs to be met we need to be at percent in this june at the nato summit and then let s talk about exceeding it which what is what president trump has been talking about with percent of gdp europe needs to step up for their own defense as a partner and we can be friends and allies and have those tough conversations ms leavitt great peter q thank you karoline i have a ukraine one and a doge one who can talk doge ms leavitt stephen go ahead q well so so stephen we re hearing about these doge dividend checks that would be percent back to taxpayers percent to pay down the debt sixty percent is left who gets that mr miller well the way that it works is when you achieve savings you can either return it to taxpayers you can return it to our debtors or it can be cycled into next year s budget and then it just lowers the overall baseline for next year so in other words you can just transfer it into the next fiscal window and then lower the overall spending level and that means that you can achieve a permanent savings that way and that reduces the deficit q and when is it that people might see those checks mr miller well this is all going to be worked on through the reconciliation process with congress that s going underway right now as you ve seen the senate is moving a bill the house is moving a bill the president has great confidence in both chambers to deliver on his priorities i would just take this opportunity to note that president trump has made a historic commitment to the working class of this country to fight for a major tax relief and major price relief and cutting spending as doge is doing and cutting taxes is the key to delivering on both of those promises and president trump is resolutely committed to doing both q thank you and on ukraine i guess this is for mike mr waltz sure q after the president s post on truth social yesterday need to know who does he think is more responsible for the russian invasion of ukraine putin or zelenskyy mr waltz well look his his goal peter is to bring this war to an end period and there has been ongoing fighting on both sides it is world war i style trench warfare his frustration with president zelenskyy is that you ve heard is multifold one there needs to be a deep appreciation for what the american people what the american taxpayer what president trump did in in his first term and what we ve done since so some of the rhetoric coming out of kyiv frankly and and insults to president trump were unacceptable number one number two our own secretary of treasury personally made the trip to offer the ukrainians what is can only be described as a historic opportunity that is for america to coinvest with ukraine in their minerals in their resources to truly grow the pie so case in point there s a foundry that processes aluminum in ukraine it s it s been damaged it s not at its current capacity if that is restored it would account for america s entire imports of aluminum for an entire year that one foundry there are tremendous resources there not only is that long term security for ukraine not only do we help them grow the pie with investments but you know we do have an obligation to the american taxpayer in helping them recoup the hundreds of billions that ha that have occurred so you know rather than enter enter into some constructive conversations about what that deal should be going forward we got a lot of rhetoric in the media that was that was incredibly unfortunate and i could just tell you peter you know as a veteran as somebody who s been in combat this war is horrific and i think we ve lost sight of that of the literally thousands of people that are dying a day families that are going without the next generation and i find it kind of you know frankly ridiculous so many people in washington that were just demanding pounding the table for a ceasefire in gaza are suddenly aghast that the president would demand one and both sides come to the table when it talks to when it comes to ukraine a war that has been arguably far greater in in scope and scale and far more dangerous in terms of global escalation to u s security q and i do have one for karoline ms leavitt sure q does president trump have a bet with trudeau about this usa canada hockey game tonight laughter and when there is a big hockey game on is the president watching for the goals or for the fights ms leavitt laughs probably both i think he s watching for the united states to win tonight i know he talked to the usa hockey team this morning he talked to the players after their morning practice around o clock and i also spoke to some folks from that team after they were jubilant over president trump s comments to the team i believe they re going to put out a video of that call so he looks forward to watching the game tonight and we look forward to the united states beating our soon to be st state canada laughter bloomberg go ahead q my question is for mike waltz can you give us a readout of kellogg s meeting with zelenskyy that just wrapped up and in particular zelenskyy publicly rejected this deal about the rare earth minerals where where does that stand mr waltz well we re going to continue to have he needs to come back to the table and we re going to continue to have discussions about where that deal is going again we have an obligation to the taxpayer i think this is an opportunity the president thinks this is an opportunity for ukraine going forward there can be in my view nothing better for ukraine s future and for their security than than to have the united states invested in their prosperity long term and then a key piece of this has also been security guarantees look the the reality that we re talking about here is is it in ukraine s interest is it in europe s interest it certainly isn t in russia s interest or in the american people s interest for this war to grind on forever and ever and ever so a key part of his conversation was helping president zelenskyy understand this war needs to come to an end this kind of open ended mantra that we ve had under the biden administration that s over and i think a lot of people are having a hard time accepting that and then the other piece is there s been discussions from prime minister starmer and also president macron about european led security guarantees we welcome that we ve been asking europe to step up and secure its own prosperity safety and security so we certainly welcome that and we certainly welcome more european assistance as i told my counterparts come to the table with more if if you want a bigger seat at the table and we ve been asking for that for quite some time q and has russia pushed for sanctions in your talks with them and have you consulted with international partners and allies about potentially rolling back sanctions in these negotiations to end the war mr waltz those the talks with with our russian counterparts both with my counterpart the national security advisor secretary rubio s counterpart the foreign minister foreign minister lavrov you know it it really were was quite broad focused on what is the goals for our broader relationship but very clear that the fighting has to stop to get to any of those brighter goals and as a first step we re just going to do some commonsense things like restore the the ability of both of our embassies to function and again you know this is this was common sense in in foreign policy world they call it shuttle diplomacy we have to talk to both sides in order to get to both sides to the table and both sides have said only president trump could do that ms leavitt diana q thank you and my question is for mike waltz laughter mr waltz all right q the president has called zelenskyy a dictator does he view putin as a dictator and does he want zelenskyy out of power i know he s called for elections and then thirdly the head of the defense committee in ukraine s parliament just has claimed that the u s has stopped selling weapons to ukraine is that true mr waltz well most of our weapons that have gone to ukraine have been part of a drawdown authority where we ve literally taken them out of our stocks and then eventually through appropriations started buying them again to refill our stocks i ll you know just state that there has been a lag in a lot of that process so many of our stocks as we look at our operations around the world are becoming more depleted that s one of the reasons many people have had a lot of concern about when does this end how much is it going to take how many lives will be lost how much will we be how much will we spend as a member of congress we repeatedly asked the biden administration those questions and we never got a satisfactory answer look president trump is obviously very frustrated right now with president zelenskyy the fact that that he hasn t come to the table that he hasn t been willing to take this opportunity that we have offered i think he eventually will get to that point and i hope so very quickly but president trump is as we made clear to our russian counterparts and i want to make clear today he s focused on stopping the fighting and moving forward and we could argue all day long about what s happened in the past ms leavitt reagan q thanks i have a question for stephen cross talk q and a question for mike ms leavitt excuse me i just called on reagan reagan go ahead q i have a question for stephen and a question for mike ms leavitt sure q stephen i can start with you there have been reports mr miller thank you q that trump is unhappy with the rate of deportations and he wants them to be higher is the president happy with the rate of deportations and are there any plans to speed up the process mr miller well first of all we all appreciate the encouragement from the media to deport as many illegal aliens as humanly possible so thank you and i will promise you that the full might of the department of homeland security the department of justice the department of defense and every element and instrument of national power will be used to remove with speed all criminal illegals from the soil of the united states of america to enforce final removal orders and to ensure that this country is for american citizens and those who legally belong in this country we inherited an ice that was completely shuttered we inherited a department of homeland security whose sole mission was to resettle illegal aliens within the united states of america in days the president sealed the border shut declared the cartels to be terrorist organizations has increased ice deportations to levels not seen in decades and we are shortly on the verge of achieving a pace and speed of deportations this country has never before seen thank you q and mike mr waltz mm hmm q there have been reports that there s some underground opposition to trump s pick for undersecretary of defense for policy elbridge colby have you or anyone from the administration been personally lobbying senators to support elbridge colby mr waltz look i ve worked with bridge co colby in the past he has the president s full support to be the undersecretary of policy which will be a critical policy arm for secretary hegseth going forward that will implement a lot of these policies and and really that s that s been the extent of it i think there s been a lot of kind of you know breathless i don t know back and forth in the in the press but we re full speed ahead to get the president s team in place so we can implement his america first policy ms leavitt thank you mike has spoken pretty extensively does anybody have questions for stephen or for mr hassett q i do ms leavitt nobody wants to talk about the economy laughter cross talk ms leavitt sure q irs ms leavitt irs okay go ahead q and this would be for either one of you so we have reported several other outlets have reported that about people are due to be lose their jobs at the irs by the end of the week if the goal of these spending cuts across the federal government has been to reduce the debt why impose some of the deepest cuts we ve seen so far at the agency responsible for raising revenue for the federal government mr hassett well i think our objective is to make sure that the employees that we pay are being productive and effective and there are many many more than people working to collect taxes and not all of them are fully occupied and the treasury secretary is studying the matter and feels like is a small number and probably can get bigger especially as we improve the it at the irs and so so i think that it s absolutely something that is on the table for good reasons and the point is that don t just talk about the irs talk about all of government that there are so many places i live in d c you maybe live in d c where you never there nobody nobody is going into the buildings people aren t commuting because nobody is doing their job we look back and we see that there are all these people doing two jobs while they re getting a government payroll on the payroll so the point is we re fixing that and the irs is a small part of that picture q so you re saying that everybody who s being let go was doing a bad job mr hassett i m saying that we re studying every agency and deciding who to let go and why and we re doing so very rationally with a lot of support from analysis q because we re being told by a lot of people who have been let go at other agencies that they were told they were being dismissed because of poor performance when in some cases they haven t even had a performance review yet because they ve only been on the job a couple of months mr hassett yeah i ve never seen a person who was laid off for poor performance say that they were performing poorly laughter okay q karoline ms leavitt good point sure kaitlan q i have a question i ll start with you kevin hassett thank you for being here and then i ve got a question for mr waltz on these potential checks that you might send out from doge is there a concern as you re thinking through this that they could be inflationary mr hassett oh absolutely not because imagine if we don t spend government money and we give it back to people then the you know if they spend it all then you re even but they re probably going to save a lot of it in which case you re reducing inflation q okay so you re not mr hassett and also when the government spends a lot that s what creates inflation we learned that from joe biden and so if we reduce government spending then that s you know reduces inflation and if you give people money then they re going to save a bunch of it and and when they save it then that also reduces demand and reduces inflation q okay so you re not worried about it mr hassett no i m not q and mr waltz to follow up on peter s question you wrote in an op ed in the fall of that quote putin is to blame certainly like al qaeda was to blame for mr waltz mm hmm q do you still feel that way now or do you share the president s assessment as he says ukraine is to blame for the start of this war mr waltz well it shouldn t surprise you that i share the president s assessment on all kinds of issues what i wrote as a member of congress is was as a former member of congress look what i share the president s assessment on is that the war has to end and what comes with that what comes with that should be at some point elections what comes with that should be peace what comes with that is prosperity that we ve just offered in this natural resources and economic partnership arrangement an end to the killing and european security and security for the world the president is not only determined to do that in europe he s determined to do it in the middle east and just a few months ago we had an administration that had tried for months week after week sitting with you here and couldn t get us to a ceasefire couldn t get our hostages out now we re at that point we re back to the maximum pressure on iran and we will we have just begun and we will drive towards a ceasefire and all of those other steps i m not going to pre negotiate or get ahead of the sequencing of all of that it s a very delicate situation but this is a president of peace and who here would argue against peace q okay so you do share that assessment and can i follow up in ms leavitt no go ahead jordan q then president trump ms leavitt go ahead jordan q can i just follow up really quickly q thank you so ms leavitt you just had two questions kaitlan q may i can i just ms leavitt jordan go ahead q mr mr hassett ms leavitt thank you q i have an important follow up for mike waltz ms leavitt jordan go ahead go ahead q so mr hassett you were speaking about tariff revenue and you also addressed a question about the r irs president trump has spoken about replacing income tax with tariff revenue especially with all this waste fraud and abuse that we re seeing cut is that a possibility mr hassett absolutely and in fact if you think about the china tariff revenue that we re estimating is coming in from the percent that we just added plus the de minimis thing that it s between $ billion and a trillion dollars over years is our estimate and that s something that is outside of the reductions that markets are seeing through the negotiations up on the hill and so we expect that the tariff revenue is actually going to make it much easier for republicans to pass a bill and that was the president s plan all along thank you q and i i have a question for stephen miller about doge so you you spoke about doge you said roughly $ billion is set to be cut in a year of waste fraud and abuse by unelected bureaucrats we re hearing this ironic narrative from the president s critics and the left wing media that elon musk is an unelected bureaucrat and he s doing all this terrible stuff isn t one of doge s objectives to get get rid of the federal bureaucracy the the deep state and also who was running the white house when joe biden was in office mr miller laughs q because i don t know a single person who believes it was joe biden mr miller yes you re you re tempting me to say laughs some very harsh things about some of our media friends the yes it is true that many of the people in this room for four years failed to cover the fact that joe biden was mentally incompetent and was not running the country it is also true that many people in this room who have used this talking point that elon is not elected fail to understand how government works so i m glad for the opportunity for a brief civics lesson a president is elected by the whole american people he s the only official in the entire government that is elected by the entire nation right judges are appointed members of congress are elected at the district or state level just one man and the constitution article two has a clause known as the vesting clause and it says the executive power shall be vested in a president singular the whole will of democracy is imbued into the elected president that president then appoints staff to then impose that democratic will onto the government the threat to democracy indeed the existential threat to democracy is the unelected bureaucracy of lifetime tenured civil servants who believe they answer to no one who believe they can do whatever they want without consequence who believe they can set their own agenda no matter what americans vote for so americans vote for radical fbi reform and fbi agents say they don t want to change or americans vote for radical reform in our energy policies but epa bureaucrats say they don t want to change or americans vote to end dei racist dei policies and lawyers in the department of justice say they don t want to change what president trump is doing is he is removing federal bureaucrats who are defying democracy by failing to implement his lawful orders which are the will of the whole american people thank you q thanks stephen can i follow up q karoline ms leavitt thank you very much everybody i m looking at the clock we ve almost had an hour of time cross talk leavitt i know a

11:06 A.M. EST
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much, Klaus.  And hello to everyone in beautiful Davos.      This has been a truly historic week in the United States.  Three days ago, I took the oath of office, and we began the golden age of America.  The recent presidential election was won by millions of votes and all seven — every one of them — all seven swing states.  It was a massive mandate from the American people like hasn’t been seen in many years.  And some of the political pundits, even some of my so-called enemies, said it was the most consequential election victory in 129 years.  That’s quite nice.      What the world has witnessed in the past 72 hours is nothing less than a revolution of common sense.  Our country will soon be stronger, wealthier, and more united than ever before, and the entire planet will be more peaceful and prosperous as a result of this incredible momentum and what we’re doing and going to do.     My administration is acting with unprecedented speed to fix the disasters we’ve inherited from a totally inept group of people and to solve every single crisis facing our country.      This begins with confronting the economic chaos caused by the failed policies of the last administration.  Over the past four years, our government racked up $8 trillion in wasteful deficit spending and inflicted nation-wrecking energy restrictions, crippling regulations, and hidden taxes like never before.  The result is the worst inflation crisis in modern history and sky-high interest rates for our citizens and even throughout the world.  Food prices and the price of almost every other thing known to mankind went through the roof.      President Biden totally lost control of what was going on in our country but, in particular, with our high-inflation economy and at our border.  Because of these ruinous policies, total government spending this year is $1.5 trillion higher than was projected to occur when I left office just four years ago.  Likewise, the cost of servicing the debt is more than 230 percent higher than was projected in 2020.
The inflation rate we are inheriting remains 50 percent higher than the historic target.  It was the highest inflation probably in the history of our country.  That’s why, from the moment I took office, I’ve taken rapid action to reverse each and every one of these radical left policies that created this calamity — in particular, with immigration, crime, and inflation.      On day one, I signed an executive order directing every member of my Cabinet to marshal all powers at their disposal to defeat inflation and reduce the cost of daily life.  I imposed a federal hiring freeze, a federal regulation freeze, a foreign aid freeze, and I created the new Department of Government Efficiency.      I terminated the ridiculous and incredibly wasteful Green New Deal — I call it the “Green New Scam”; withdrew from the one-sided Paris Climate Accord; and ended the insane and costly electric vehicle mandate.  We’re going to let people buy the car they want to buy.      I declared a national em- — energy emergency — and it’s so important — national energy emergency to unlock the liquid gold under our feet and pave the way for rapid approvals of new energy infrastructure.  The United States has the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth, and we’re going to use it.      Not only will this reduce the cost of virtually all goods and services, it will make the United States a manufacturing superpower and the world capital of artificial intelligence and crypto.     My administration has also begun the largest deregulation campaign in history, far exceeding even the record-setting efforts of my last term.      In total, the Biden administration imposed $50,000 in additional regulatory costs on the average American household over the last four years.  I have promised to eliminate 10 old regulations for every new regulation, which will soon put many thousands of dollars back in the pockets of American families.     To further unleash our economy, our majorities in the House and Senate — which we also took, along with the presidency — are going to pass the largest tax cut in American history, including massive tax cuts for workers and family and big tax cuts for domestic producers and manufacturers.  And we’re working with the Democrats on getting an extension of the original Trump tax cuts, as you probably know by just reading any paper.     My message to every business in the world is very simple: Come make your product in America, and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on Earth.  We’re bringing them down very substantially, even from the original Trump tax cuts.  But if you don’t make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then, very simply, you will have to pay a tariff — differing amounts, but a tariff — which will direct hundreds of billions of dollars and even trillions of dollars into our Treasury to strengthen our economy and pay down debt.      Under the Trump administration, there will be no better place on Earth to create jobs, build factories, or grow a company than right here in the good old USA.      Already, American’s economic — and you can see this, I think, maybe even in your — in your wonderful, wonderful room that you’re all gathered together — so many of my friends — but, Americans, the economic confidence is soaring like we haven’t seen in many, many decades, maybe not at all.      Upon my election, it was just announced that small-business optimism skyrocketed by 41 points in a single month.  That’s the highest ever.  There’s never been anything like that.      SoftBank has announced between a $100 and $200 billion investment in the U.S. economy because of the election result.  And just two days ago, Oracle, SoftBank, and OpenAI announced a $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure.  Other companies, likewise, have announced billions and billions and billions — adding up to trillions — of investment in America, in the United States.      And it’s also reported today in the papers that Saudi Arabia will be investing at least $600 billion in America.  But I’ll be asking the crown prince, who’s a fantastic guy, to round it out to around $1 trillion.  I think they’ll do that because we’ve been very good to them.  And I’m also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil.  You got to bring it down, which, frankly, I’m surprised they didn’t do before the election.  That didn’t show a lot of love by them not doing it.  I was a little surprised by that.      If the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately.  Right now, the price is high enough that that war will continue.  You got to bring down the oil price; you’re going to end that war.  They should have done it long ago.  They’re very responsible, actually, to a certain extent, for what’s taking place — millions of lives are being lost.      With oil prices going down, I’ll demand that interest rates drop immediately.  And, likewise, they should be dropping all over the world.  Interest rates should follow us.      All over, the progress that you’re seeing is happening because of our historic victory in a recent presidential election, one that has become quite well known throughout the world.
I think a lot of things are happening to a lot of countries.  They say that there’s light shining all over the world since the election.  And even countries that we aren’t particularly friendly with are happy because they understand what — there is a future and th- — how great the future will be.
Under our leadership, America is back and open for business.  And this week, I’m also taking swift action to stop the invasion at our southern border.  They allowed people to come in at levels that nobody has ever seen before.  It was ridiculous.  I decided a — and declared to dec- — to — to do — and very, very importantly — a national emergency on our border; immediately halted all entry of illegal border crossers, of which there were many; and began properly returning the illegal trespassers back to the place from which they came.
That action, as you’ve probably seen, has already started very strongly.  I have deployed active-duty U.S. military and National Guard troops to the border to assist in repelling the invasion.  It was really an invasion.  We will not allow our territory to be violated.
After four long years, the United States is strong and sovereign and a beautiful nation once again. It’s a strong, sovereign nation.
In addition, I’m pleased to report that America is also a free nation once again.  On day one, I signed an executive order to stop all government censorship.  No longer will our government label the speech of our own citizens as misinformation or disinformation, which are the favorite words of censors and those who wish to stop the free exchange of ideas and, frankly, progress.  We have saved free speech in America, and we’ve saved it strongly.
With another historic executive order this week, I also ended the weaponization of law enforcement against the American people — and, frankly, against politicians — and restored the fair, equal, and impartial rule of law.
My administration has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion nonsense — and these are policies that were absolute nonsense — throughout the government and the private sector.  With the recent, yet somewhat unexpected, great Supreme Court decision just made, America will once again become a merit-based country.  You have to hear that word: merit-based country.
And I’ve made it official — an official policy of the United States that there are only two genders, male and female, and we will have no men participating in women’s sports, and transgender operations, which became the rage, will occur very rarely.
Finally, as we restore common sense in America, we’re moving quickly to bring back strength and peace and stability abroad.  I’m also going to ask all NATO nations to increase defense spending to 5 percent of GDP, which is what it should have been years ago — it was only at 2 percent, and most nations didn’t pay until I came along; I insisted that they pay, and they did — because the United States was really paying the difference at that time, and it’s — it was unfair to the United States.  But many, many things have been unfair for many years to the United States.
Before even taking office, my team negotiated a ceasefire agreement in the Middle East, which wouldn’t have happened without us, as I think most of the people in the room know.  Earlier this week, the hostages began to return to their families.  They are returning, and it’s a beautiful sight.  And they’ll be coming in more and more.  They started coming back on Sunday.
Our efforts to secure a peace settlement between Russia and Ukraine are now, hopefully, underway.  It’s so important to get that done.  That is an absolute killing field.
Millions of soldiers are being killed.  Nobody has seen anything like it since World War II.  They’re laying dead all over the flat fields.  It’s a flat field — farmland, and there’s millions of Russians and millions of Ukrainians.  Nobody’s seen anything like it since World War II.  It’s time to end it.
And here in America, we have big events coming up.  Next year we have the 250th anniversary of America’s founding.  I’m so honored to be president during that.  That’s been a big event.  They’ve been talking about it for 10 years.  We also have the World Cup, and I understand Gianni — Gianni is in the room — Infantino.  He was very instrumental in helping us get it — he’s there with you someplace, I think — and I want to thank him for that.
And then we have the Olympics coming up, which I was instrumental in getting, also, in my first term.  And who would have known that by skipping a term, I would get the Olympics?  I was upset.  I said, “You know, I got the Olympics to come and I won’t be president.”  But it turned out, through a stroke of luck or whatever you might call it, that I’m going to be president during the World Cup and the Olympics and the 250th
anniversary.  So, that’s going to be three big events.
And we’ve accomplished more in less than four days — we have really been working — four days — than other administrations have accomplished in four years, and we’re just getting started.  It’s really an amazing thing to see, and the spirit and the light over our country has been incredible.
Under the last administration, our nation has suffered greatly, but we are going to bring it back and make it greater, bigger, stronger, better than ever before.
I want to thank everybody for being with you.  I would have been there myself, except the inauguration was two days ago.  I thought it might be a little bit quick to make it the first stop, but we’ll get there one day.  We hope to get there.
But I — I do appreciate — I heard the audience is fantastic, and many of my friends are in the audience.  And I will be taking questions now from some very distinguished people.
Thank you all very much.  (Applause.)
MR. BRENDE:  Thank you.  Thank you very much, Mr.  President, for that very powerful speech, and I think you could hear the applause all the way from Davos to the White House.  But next year, it will be even better, because then you can get the applause here in Davos.  So, we wish you welcome to our village next year.  We hope to see you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
MR. BRENDE:  So, we also know, Mr. President, that you open up for interaction here.  We have a great panel with some of the most distinguished businesspeople in the world.
Let me start with someone that you know really well, that I think is almost a neighbor of you in Mal-a- — in — in Florida, Mr. Steve Schwarzman, chairman, CEO, and cofounder of Blackstone Group.
So, Steve, floor is yours.
MR. SCHWARZMAN:  Well, Mr. President —
THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, Steve.
MR. SCHWARZMAN:  — I’m sure the crown prince of Saudi Arabia will be really glad you gave this speech today.  (Laughter.)
THE PRESIDENT:  I hope so.
MR. SCHWARZMAN:  You’ve had the busiest four days that anybody can imagine, and congratulations for that.
And my question is — is about some of the things I’ve observed here at Davos.  It’s a terrific forum.  I’ve met lots of people, as usual.  I think I’ve been here 30 years.  And a lot of the European businesspeople have expressed enormous frustration with the regulatory regime in the EU, and they attribute slower growth rates here because of numerous factors, but especially because of regulations.
And you’ve taken a completely different approach in this area.  And if you could explain the theory of what you’re doing, how you’re going to do it, and what you expect the outcome to be, I’d appreciate it.
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  And congratulations, Steve — you’re a friend of mine — but on a great career.  You have had an amazing career and continues.  So, I just want to congratulate you.  Very inspirational to a lot of people.
I want to talk about the EU, because you mentioned specifically that I’ve also had a lot of friends and leaders of countries.  I’ve gotten to know them all my first term and a little bit during this period of four years and know them well, like them a lot, but they’re very frustrated because of the time everything seems to take to get approved — environmental impact statements for things that you shouldn’t even have to do that, and many, many other ways that it takes.
And I’m going to give you a quick little example.  I w- — in the private life, my beautiful private life — before I had all these things happening — the world is a little different — I had a nice, simple life.  You knew that.
But when I had that simple life, I did projects, and I had a big project in Ireland, and it had to get approval on something that would have made it even better.  And I got the approval from Ireland in a period of a week, and it was a very, very, very efficient, good approval.
And they informed me, though, “The problem is you’re going to have to get it from the EU, and we think that’ll take five to six years.”  And I said, “You have to be kidding.”  And this was before politics.  And I said, “Wait a minute.  It’s not that important.  I don’t want to go five or six years.”  But it would have been a big investment.  It would have been nice, and it would have been good for the project.
And I sent the people to the EU to see if they could speed it up, and basically it was a five- or six-year wait just to get a simple approval that Ireland gave me in a period of, literally, not much more than a week.
And I realized right then — that was the first time I really was involved with the EU, but I realized right then, that’s a problem, and I didn’t even bother applying to do it, and — or if I did, I pulled it very quickly.  I don’t wa- — I have to be very accurate, because I don’t want to be criticized.  “He did apply, actually.”  No, I want to be very accurate.  So, I don’t think I did, but if I did, I pulled it very quickly.  It was just something you — you couldn’t wait five years or six years to get an approval.
So, a lot of — in a very big business sense, a lot of people are — are claiming that’s the problem.      From the standpoint of America, the EU treats us very, very unfairly, very badly.  They have a large tax that we know about and — a VAT tax — and it’s a very substantial one.  They don’t take our far- — essentially, don’t take our farm products and they don’t take our cars.  Yet, they send cars to us by the millions.
They put tariffs on things that we want to do, like, for instance, I think they actually — in terms of these are noneconomic or nonmonetary tariffs, and — and those are very bad, and they make it very difficult to bring products into Europe, and yet they expect to be selling and they do sell their products in the United States.
So, we have, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars of deficits with the EU, and nobody is happy with it.  And we’re going to do something about it, but nobody is happy with it.  So, I think the EU has to speed up their process.
Friends of mine that are in some of the nations within the EU, great people, they — they want to be able to compete better, and you can’t compete when you can’t get — go through the approval process fast.  There’s no reason why it can’t go faster.
So, you know, I’m — I’m trying to be constructive, because I love Europe.  I love the countries of Europe.  But the process is a very cumbersome one, and th- — and they do treat the United States of America very, very unfairly with the VAT taxes and all of the other taxes they impose.
One other — just to finish up, I got a call from the head of a major airline, one of the biggest airlines in the world.  And he said, “Sir, could you help us?”  “What?” “Landing in Europe is brutal.  They charge us fees for everything, and it’s so unfair.”  I said, “How does it compare to China?”  He said, “It’s — it’s much worse.”
And the other thing, as you know, they took court cases with Apple, and they supposedly won a case that most people didn’t think was much of a case.  They won $15 or $16 billion from Apple.  They won billions from Google.  I think they’re after Facebook for billions and billions.
These are American companies.  Whether you like them or not, they’re — they’re American companies, and they shouldn’t be doing that.  And that’s — as far as I’m concerned, it’s a form of taxation.
So, we have some very big complaints with the EU.      Thank you.
MR. BRENDE:  Tha- — thank you very much, Mr. President.  We’ll now go to one of your friends in the EU, Patrick Pouyanné.  He’s the chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies.      I guess you have a question ready, Patrick, for the president.
MR. POUYANNÉ:  Mr. President, as we understand, energy is at the top of your agenda, and it’s an honor for me to represent the energy industry tonight in this panel.  TotalEnergies is indeed the fourth largest oil and gas and electricity company in the world.
I will not ask you a question about the oil price.  It’s quite clear what you expect from us.  I will more go to gas more.  And we, our company, is the largest, number one exporter LNG from the U.S. company.  We are a strong contributor to and we invest in mammoth LNG projects in Texas, $20 billion.  It’s far from $200, but it’s $20 billion.  And we contribute with that to security of supply to Europe as we export this LNG to Europe.
Some experts fear that if there are too many projects developed in the U.S. on LNG, this could have an inflat- — inflationary impact on the U.S. domestic gas price, and they recommend a pause on these projects.
I would ask you the following question: What are your views on — about such a pause on investments on LNG in the U.S.?  What would happen if you would observe an increased domestic gas price because of these exports?  And final question, which is important for Europe: Would you agree to guarantee security of supplies of U.S. LNG to Europe?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, on the last part of your question, yes, I would.  I would make sure that you get it.  If we make a deal, we make a deal; you’ll get it.  Because a lot of people do have that problem.  They make a deal, and then it can’t get supplied because of war-type problems and other problems.  So, we would absolutely do that.
LNG is very interesting, because when I took office for the first term, one of the first things I looked at was two — there were two very massive plants in Louisiana, a state that has been very good to me.  I won it by many, many points, and
I felt strongly indebted to it, actually.
And they said there are two plants that have been under environmental consideration for more than 10 years, and they were costing — as you say, you know how expensive those plants are — but they were costing like $12 billion and, I think, $14 or $15 billion.  But they couldn’t get their permits.  It was — they were in review for years — many, many years — like a decade or more.
And I said, “So ridiculous.”  I know so much about that, because in the construction industry, I had to go through it too, but I got good at it after a while.
But I — I went — I saw the projects, and you’re talking about a total investment of $25 to $30 billion, and it looked like it was going to end.  They couldn’t get their permits, and I got them done in less than a week.  It was done, completed.
In fact, when they called them to announce that it was done, the countries — largely countries — Japan was involved and — and another country and some very big investors — they couldn’t believe it.  They actually couldn’t believe it.
And I said, “Just do yourself one favor.  Don’t pay any consultants, because the only one that got it done was me.”  I got it done because it was the right thing to do for the U.S. and for the world, but the consultants had nothing to do with it, you know?  The consultants go in and they say, “Give us millions of dollars because Trump did it.”  Nobody called me about it.  I just heard it was a problem for years, and I got it done because it was the right thing to do for the U.S. and the right thing to do for beyond.  It had to do with energy — very important.
So, I think it’s very important.  I think the — the — you know, I disagree with one.  I think the more that you do, the lower the price is going to go.  And what I’d like to see is rapid approvals.
We’re going to give very rapid approvals in the United States, like with the AI plants, talking to — many people want to build them.  That’s going to be a very big thing.
We’re going to build electric generating facilities — they are going to build.  I’m going to get them the approval.  Under emergency declaration, I can get the approvals done myself without having to go through years of waiting.
And the big problem is we need double the energy we currently have in the United States — can you imagine? — for AI to really be as big as we want to have it.  Because it’s a very competitive — it will be very competitive with China and others.
So, I’m going to give emergency declarations so that they can start building them almost immediately.
And I’m — I’m — I think it was largely my idea, because nobody thought this was possible.  It wasn’t that they were not smart, because they’re the smartest, but I told them that what I want you to do is build your electric generating plant right next to your plant as a separate building, connected.  And they said, “Wow, you’re kidding.”  And I said, “No, no.  I’m not kidding.”  You don’t have to hook into the grid, which is old and, you know, could be taken out.  If it’s taken out, they wouldn’t have any way to get any electricity.
So, we are going to allow them to go on a very rapid bas- — basis to build their plant — build the electric generating plant.  They can fuel it with anything they want, and they may have coal as a backup.  Good, clean coal.
You know, if there were a problem with a — with a pipe coming in — as an example, you’re going with gas — oil or gas — and a pipe gets blown up or, for some reason, doesn’t work, there are some companies in the U.S. that have coal sitting right by the plant so that if there’s an emergency, they can go to that short-term basis and use our very clean coal.
So, that’s something else that a lot of people didn’t even know about.  But nothing can destroy coal — not the weather, not a bomb — nothing.  It might make it a little smaller, might make it a little different shape.  But coal is very strong as a backup.  It’s a great backup to have that facility, and it wouldn’t cost much more — more money.
And we have more coal than anybody.  We also have more oil and gas than anybody.
So, we’re going to make it so that the plants will have their own electric generating facilities attached right to their plant.  They don’t have to worry about a utility.  They don’t have to worry about anything.  And we’re going to get very rapid approvals.
MR. BRENDE:  Thank you.  Thank you so much, Mr. President.  We’ll now go to another CEO that you know very well: Brian Moynihan, the CEO and chair of Bank of America.
MR. MOYNIHAN:  Good afternoon, Mr. President, and congratulations — an obviously eventful week for you and your family.
If you remember, five years ago, you came here and we walked among 150 CEOs from all over the world, and you engaged with them about your policies and your procedures.
This year, you’re not here.  And yet this week was eventful, from the orders that you mentioned earlier — literally a wave of orders coming out on immigration, on trade, and many other matters.
And so, as a representative of the United States here,
we got a lot of questions about what does all this mean and how would the president square this with his clear focus on growth, prosperity, market gro- — stock market growth, a good bond market, and bringing down prices.
So, how do you think about the impact of all these orders and how fast they come out and how you’re going to balance them with that scorecard of being successful on both contan- — continuing GDP growth, bringing down inflation, and also having a good stock price appreciation for the American citizen?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think it’s going to actually bring down inflation.  It’s going to bring up jobs.  We’re going to have a lot of jobs.  We’re going to have a lot of companies moving in.
You know, Brian, we’re at 21 percent.  It was at 40 percent, and I got it down to 21 percent — the corporate tax.  And it was — actually, if you look at state and city, it was, in many cases, much higher than 40 percent.  I got it down to 21 percent.  And now we’re going to bring it down from 21 to 15 percent if — this is a big “if” — if you make your product in the U.S.
So, we’re going to have the lowest — just about the lowest rate.  It will be — the 21 is on the low side worldwide; the 15 is about as low as it gets, and by far the lowest of a large country — a large, you know, rich, powerful country — by far, not even a contest.
So, we’re going to bring it down to 15 percent if you make your product in the USA.  So, that’s going to create a — a tremendous buzz.
We’re also probably going back to the one-year deduction, where we deduct — you know, we — we did that originally, and that was amazing what — the impact that that had, the one-year deduction, which built up over a period of time and then it expires.  But we’re going to go back to that when we do the renewal of the Trump tax plan.
We have to get Democrats to approve it.  But, you know, if the Democrats didn’t approve it, I don’t know how they can survive with about a 45 percent tax increase, because that’s what it would be.  And so, I think they’re going to b- — w- — we’ve been working along with them pretty well.
I think it’s very hard for a political group to say, “Let’s charge people 45 percent more.”  So, I think we’re in good shape.
But we’re actually doing a reduction for business and small businesses, where you’re going to b- — bring it down to 15 percent, which is really something.
And, by the way, speaking of you — and you’ve done a fantastic job — but I hope you start opening your bank to conservatives, because many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, and that included a place called Bank of America.  This conserve- — they don’t take conservative business.  And I don’t know if the regulators mandated that because of Biden or what, but you and Jamie and everybody, I hope you’re going to open your banks to conservatives, because what you’re doing is wrong.
MR. MOYNIHAN:  Mr. President —     MR. BRENDE:  (Inaudible.)
MR. MOYNIHAN:  — I’ll say that your friend Gianni was — said hello — told me tell you hello, and we look forward to sponsoring the World Cup when it comes, both this summer for the club and next year.  So, thank you for getting that for the United States.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Brian.
MR. BRENDE:  Thank you, Mr. President.  We’ll now go to Ana Botín.  She’s the executive chairman of Banco Santander, one of the big European banks and also in the U.S.
So, Ana.
MS. BOTÍN:  Mr. President, congratulations on a historic victory.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
MS. BOTÍN:  I believe you don’t know me as well as my fellow panelists, so a few words.  Santander is one of the largest banks in the world by number of customers, 170 million.  That’s more than my friend Brian or my friend Jamie have.  (Laughter.)
THE PRESIDENT:  Wow.
MS. BOTÍN:  And those — (applause) —
MR. MOYNIHAN:  If they fix the regulation (inaudible).
MS. BOTÍN:  That’s coming.  That’s coming.
MR. BRENDE:  That was cheeky.  (Laughter.)
MS. BOTÍN:  We are — we are a big investor in the United States.  We have many million customer, 12,000 employees.  We’re one of the largest auto lenders, and we recently launched a fully digital bank called Openbank.
We strongly believe banks have a pivotal role in the economy, and we can accelerate growth and help many more customers.  That’s what we do in the United States.  So, as Brian pointed out, we very much welcome your focus on deregulation and reducing bureaucracy.
So, my question is: What are your priorities in this regard, and how fast is this going to happen?  Thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think it’s going to — thank you and congratulations.  I know very much about your bank, and you’ve done a fantastic job.  Congratulations.
We are going to move very quickly.  We’ve moved very quickly.  We’ve done things in the last three days that nobody thought were possible to do in years.  And it’s all taken — it’s all taken effect.  It’s going to have a huge impact on the economy, a huge positive impact.  Money was being wasted on crazy things.
I mean, the Green New Deal was such a total disgrace — what — what — how that was perpetrated.  And it was conceived of by people that were average students — less than average students, I might add — and never even took a course in energy or the environment.  It was just a game.  Remember, the world was going to end in 12 years?  Remember that?  Well, the 12 years has come and gone.  It was going to end.  It was going to all foam into earth.  But, you know, the time has come.
The — these people — and they — they really — they really scared the Democrats large- — I can’t say the Republicans.  Republicans maybe could have fought harder to stop it, but it’s been a tremendous waste of — a tremendous waste of money.
You know, during my four years, we had the cleanest air, we had the cleanest water, and yet we had the most productive economy in the history of our country.  We had the most productive economy.  Until COVID came, we had the most productive in the history of our country, by far.
And — and actually, you could look worldwide, we — we’re — we were beating everybody from China to everybody else.  So — and we think we really — now, with what we have learned and all of the other things that have taken place, we think we can even far surpass that — a- — actually, far, far surpass it.  But we do — one thing we’re going to be demanding is we’re going to — be demanding respect from other nations.
Canada.  We have a tremendous deficit with Canada.  We’re not going to have that anymore.  We can’t do it.  It’s — it’s — I don’t know if it’s good for them.  As you probably know, I say, “You can always become a state, and if you’re a state, we won’t have a deficit.  We won’t have to tariff you, et cetera, et cetera.”
But Canada has been very tough to deal with over the years, and it’s not fair that we should have a $200 billion or $250 billion deficit.  We don’t need them to make our cars, and they make a lot of them.  We don’t need their lumber because we have our own forests, et cetera, et cetera.  We don’t need their oil and gas.  We have our — we have more than anybody.
So, you know, just as an example, with Mexico — we’re dealing with Mexico, I think, very well.  And we’re just — you know, w- — we just want to be treated fairly with other nations, because there’s hardly a nation in the world — and I blame this on us, and I blame it on politicians that for some reason — and probably mostly it’s stupidity, but you could also say other reasons, but mostly stupidity — they’ve allowed other nations to take advantage of the U.S.  And w- — we can’t allow that to happen anymore.
You know, we have debt.  It’s a very small debt when you compare it to value — the value of the assets that we have, but we don’t want to do that.  We want to just have debt be obliterated, and we’ll be able to do that fairly rapidly.  And a lot of good things are going to happen.
And — and honestly, good things are going to happen for the world, and good things are going to happen for the people that are dealing with us — allies and beyond allies.
One thing — very important — I really would like to be able to meet with President Putin soon and get that war end — ended, and — and that’s not from the standpoint of economy or anything else.  It’s from the standpoint of millions of lives are being wasted.  Beautiful, young people are being shot in the battlefield.  You know, the bullet — a very flat land, as I said, and the bullet goes — there’s no — there’s no hiding.  And a bullet — the only thing going to stop the bullet is a human body.  And you have to see — I’ve seen pictures of what’s taken place.  It’s a carnage.
And we really have to stop that war.  That war is horrible.  And I’m not talking economy, I’m not talking economics, I’m not talking about natural resource.  I’m just talking about: There’s so many young people being killed in this war, and that’s not including the people that have been killed as the cities are being, you know, knocked down building by building.  So, we really should get that stopped.
Likewise, in the Middle East, I think we’ve made a lot of progress in the Middle East, and I think that’s going to — that’s going to come along pretty well.
Thank you very much.
MR. BRENDE:  Thank you, Mr. President.  We know that most consequential relationship in the world is between the U.S. and China.  U.S., 28 percent of the global economy; China close to 20.  That’s almost half of the global GDP.
And we know that you called President Xi Jinping last Friday.  We heard that you had a good discussion.
How do you see the relationship between the U.S. and China in the next four years under your leadership?
THE PRESIDENT:  He called me.  But I see it very good.  I think that we’re going to have a very good relationship.  All we want is fairness.  We just want a level playing field.  We don’t want to take advantage.  We’ve been having massive deficits with China.  Biden allowed it to get out of hand.  He’s — $1.1 trillion deficit.  It’s ridiculous, and it’s just an unfair relationship.
And we have to make it just fair.  We don’t have to make it phenomenal.  We have to make it a fair relationship.  Right now, it’s not a fair relationship.  The deficit is massive, as it is with other countries — a lot of Asian countries, actually.  But we have deficits that are very big, and we can’t keep doing that, so we’re not going to keep doing that.
But I like President Xi very much.  I’ve always liked him.  We always had a very good relationship.  It was very strained with COVID coming out of Wuhan.  Obviously, that strained it.  I’m sure it strained it with a lot of people, but that strained our relationship.  But we always had a great relationship, I would say, and we look forward to doing very well with China and getting along with China.
Hopefully, China can help us stop the war with, in particular, Russia-Ukraine.  And they have a great deal of power over that situation, and we’ll work with them.
And I mentioned that with — during our phone conversation with President Xi, and hopefully we could work together and get that stopped.
We’d like to see denuclearization.  In fact, with President Putin, prior to a — an election result, which was, frankly, ridiculous, we were talking about denuclearization of our two countries, and China would have come along.  China has a — a much smaller, right now, nuclear armament than us or field than us, but they’re — they’re going to be catching it at some point over the next four or five years.
And I will tell you that President Putin really liked the idea of — of cutting way back on nuclear.  And I think the rest of the world, we would have gotten them to follow.  And China would have come along too.  China also liked it.
Tremendous amounts of money are being spent on nuclear, and the destructive capability is something that we don’t even want to talk about today, because you don’t want to hear it.  It’s too depressing.
So, we want to see if we can denuclearize, and I think that’s very possible.  And I can tell you that President Putin wanted to do it.  He and I wanted to do it.  We had a good conversation with China.  They would have been involved, and that would have been an unbelievable thing for the planet.
And I hope —
MR. BRENDE:  Mr. President, when you’re —
THE PRESIDENT:  — it can be started up again.
MR. BRENDE:  — back here in Davos next year, will — will there be then a peace agreement with — with Ukraine and Russia by then?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you’re going to have to ask Russia.  Ukraine is ready to — to make a deal.
Just so you understand, this is a war that should have never started.  If I were president, it would never have started.  This is a war that should have never, ever been started.  And — and it wasn’t started during my — there was never even talk about it.  I knew that it was the apple of President Putin’s eye, but I also knew that there was no way he was going in, and he wasn’t going to go in.
And then, when I was out, bad things happened, bad things were said, a lot of stupidity all around, and you end up with what you have.  Now you have all these bombed-out cities — they look like demolition sites — with many people killed.
I think the — the thing that you’ll see about Ukraine is that far — far more people have died than is being reported.  And I’ve seen that.  But far, far more people have died.
When you look at a city that’s become a demolition site, where big buildings have been collapsed by missiles hitting them and everything else, and they say, “One person was slightly injured.”  No, no, many people were killed.  Those are big buildings.  I was surprised at how — that was my business.  These are buildings that go two and three blocks long.  They’re 20 stories high.  They’re big, powerful buildings.  Then they were knocked down, and there were a lot of people in those buildings.  They had announced that two people were injured.  That’s not true.  So, I think you’re going to find that there were many more people killed in Ukraine and the Ukraine war than anybody has any idea.
But if you look now, so many of the — the people being killed are soldiers just facing each other with guns, rifles, and drones — the new form of warfare — drones.  And it’s a very sad thing to see.
And when you see pictures of the fields that I see, nobody wants to see it.  You’ll never be the same.
MR. BRENDE:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  On behalf of all the 3,000 participants here in Davos, we really, really underline that joining us, the third day in your presidency, live, taking questions here, it’s so appreciated.  And we are already ready for receiving you next year in person.
So, thank you very much, and all the best from Davos.  (Applause.)
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)
NA",18,na na na a m est the president well thank you very much klaus and hello to everyone in beautiful davos this has been a truly historic week in the united states three days ago i took the oath of office and we began the golden age of america the recent presidential election was won by millions of votes and all seven every one of them all seven swing states it was a massive mandate from the american people like hasn t been seen in many years and some of the political pundits even some of my so called enemies said it was the most consequential election victory in years that s quite nice what the world has witnessed in the past hours is nothing less than a revolution of common sense our country will soon be stronger wealthier and more united than ever before and the entire planet will be more peaceful and prosperous as a result of this incredible momentum and what we re doing and going to do my administration is acting with unprecedented speed to fix the disasters we ve inherited from a totally inept group of people and to solve every single crisis facing our country this begins with confronting the economic chaos caused by the failed policies of the last administration over the past four years our government racked up $ trillion in wasteful deficit spending and inflicted nation wrecking energy restrictions crippling regulations and hidden taxes like never before the result is the worst inflation crisis in modern history and sky high interest rates for our citizens and even throughout the world food prices and the price of almost every other thing known to mankind went through the roof president biden totally lost control of what was going on in our country but in particular with our high inflation economy and at our border because of these ruinous policies total government spending this year is $ trillion higher than was projected to occur when i left office just four years ago likewise the cost of servicing the debt is more than percent higher than was projected in the inflation rate we are inheriting remains percent higher than the historic target it was the highest inflation probably in the history of our country that s why from the moment i took office i ve taken rapid action to reverse each and every one of these radical left policies that created this calamity in particular with immigration crime and inflation on day one i signed an executive order directing every member of my cabinet to marshal all powers at their disposal to defeat inflation and reduce the cost of daily life i imposed a federal hiring freeze a federal regulation freeze a foreign aid freeze and i created the new department of government efficiency i terminated the ridiculous and incredibly wasteful green new deal i call it the green new scam withdrew from the one sided paris climate accord and ended the insane and costly electric vehicle mandate we re going to let people buy the car they want to buy i declared a national em energy emergency and it s so important national energy emergency to unlock the liquid gold under our feet and pave the way for rapid approvals of new energy infrastructure the united states has the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth and we re going to use it not only will this reduce the cost of virtually all goods and services it will make the united states a manufacturing superpower and the world capital of artificial intelligence and crypto my administration has also begun the largest deregulation campaign in history far exceeding even the record setting efforts of my last term in total the biden administration imposed $ in additional regulatory costs on the average american household over the last four years i have promised to eliminate old regulations for every new regulation which will soon put many thousands of dollars back in the pockets of american families to further unleash our economy our majorities in the house and senate which we also took along with the presidency are going to pass the largest tax cut in american history including massive tax cuts for workers and family and big tax cuts for domestic producers and manufacturers and we re working with the democrats on getting an extension of the original trump tax cuts as you probably know by just reading any paper my message to every business in the world is very simple come make your product in america and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on earth we re bringing them down very substantially even from the original trump tax cuts but if you don t make your product in america which is your prerogative then very simply you will have to pay a tariff differing amounts but a tariff which will direct hundreds of billions of dollars and even trillions of dollars into our treasury to strengthen our economy and pay down debt under the trump administration there will be no better place on earth to create jobs build factories or grow a company than right here in the good old usa already american s economic and you can see this i think maybe even in your in your wonderful wonderful room that you re all gathered together so many of my friends but americans the economic confidence is soaring like we haven t seen in many many decades maybe not at all upon my election it was just announced that small business optimism skyrocketed by points in a single month that s the highest ever there s never been anything like that softbank has announced between a $ and $ billion investment in the u s economy because of the election result and just two days ago oracle softbank and openai announced a $ billion investment in ai infrastructure other companies likewise have announced billions and billions and billions adding up to trillions of investment in america in the united states and it s also reported today in the papers that saudi arabia will be investing at least $ billion in america but i ll be asking the crown prince who s a fantastic guy to round it out to around $ trillion i think they ll do that because we ve been very good to them and i m also going to ask saudi arabia and opec to bring down the cost of oil you got to bring it down which frankly i m surprised they didn t do before the election that didn t show a lot of love by them not doing it i was a little surprised by that if the price came down the russia ukraine war would end immediately right now the price is high enough that that war will continue you got to bring down the oil price you re going to end that war they should have done it long ago they re very responsible actually to a certain extent for what s taking place millions of lives are being lost with oil prices going down i ll demand that interest rates drop immediately and likewise they should be dropping all over the world interest rates should follow us all over the progress that you re seeing is happening because of our historic victory in a recent presidential election one that has become quite well known throughout the world i think a lot of things are happening to a lot of countries they say that there s light shining all over the world since the election and even countries that we aren t particularly friendly with are happy because they understand what there is a future and th how great the future will be under our leadership america is back and open for business and this week i m also taking swift action to stop the invasion at our southern border they allowed people to come in at levels that nobody has ever seen before it was ridiculous i decided a and declared to dec to to do and very very importantly a national emergency on our border immediately halted all entry of illegal border crossers of which there were many and began properly returning the illegal trespassers back to the place from which they came that action as you ve probably seen has already started very strongly i have deployed active duty u s military and national guard troops to the border to assist in repelling the invasion it was really an invasion we will not allow our territory to be violated after four long years the united states is strong and sovereign and a beautiful nation once again it s a strong sovereign nation in addition i m pleased to report that america is also a free nation once again on day one i signed an executive order to stop all government censorship no longer will our government label the speech of our own citizens as misinformation or disinformation which are the favorite words of censors and those who wish to stop the free exchange of ideas and frankly progress we have saved free speech in america and we ve saved it strongly with another historic executive order this week i also ended the weaponization of law enforcement against the american people and frankly against politicians and restored the fair equal and impartial rule of law my administration has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity equity and inclusion nonsense and these are policies that were absolute nonsense throughout the government and the private sector with the recent yet somewhat unexpected great supreme court decision just made america will once again become a merit based country you have to hear that word merit based country and i ve made it official an official policy of the united states that there are only two genders male and female and we will have no men participating in women s sports and transgender operations which became the rage will occur very rarely finally as we restore common sense in america we re moving quickly to bring back strength and peace and stability abroad i m also going to ask all nato nations to increase defense spending to percent of gdp which is what it should have been years ago it was only at percent and most nations didn t pay until i came along i insisted that they pay and they did because the united states was really paying the difference at that time and it s it was unfair to the united states but many many things have been unfair for many years to the united states before even taking office my team negotiated a ceasefire agreement in the middle east which wouldn t have happened without us as i think most of the people in the room know earlier this week the hostages began to return to their families they are returning and it s a beautiful sight and they ll be coming in more and more they started coming back on sunday our efforts to secure a peace settlement between russia and ukraine are now hopefully underway it s so important to get that done that is an absolute killing field millions of soldiers are being killed nobody has seen anything like it since world war ii they re laying dead all over the flat fields it s a flat field farmland and there s millions of russians and millions of ukrainians nobody s seen anything like it since world war ii it s time to end it and here in america we have big events coming up next year we have the th anniversary of america s founding i m so honored to be president during that that s been a big event they ve been talking about it for years we also have the world cup and i understand gianni gianni is in the room infantino he was very instrumental in helping us get it he s there with you someplace i think and i want to thank him for that and then we have the olympics coming up which i was instrumental in getting also in my first term and who would have known that by skipping a term i would get the olympics i was upset i said you know i got the olympics to come and i won t be president but it turned out through a stroke of luck or whatever you might call it that i m going to be president during the world cup and the olympics and the th anniversary so that s going to be three big events and we ve accomplished more in less than four days we have really been working four days than other administrations have accomplished in four years and we re just getting started it s really an amazing thing to see and the spirit and the light over our country has been incredible under the last administration our nation has suffered greatly but we are going to bring it back and make it greater bigger stronger better than ever before i want to thank everybody for being with you i would have been there myself except the inauguration was two days ago i thought it might be a little bit quick to make it the first stop but we ll get there one day we hope to get there but i i do appreciate i heard the audience is fantastic and many of my friends are in the audience and i will be taking questions now from some very distinguished people thank you all very much applause mr brende thank you thank you very much mr president for that very powerful speech and i think you could hear the applause all the way from davos to the white house but next year it will be even better because then you can get the applause here in davos so we wish you welcome to our village next year we hope to see you the president thank you very much mr brende so we also know mr president that you open up for interaction here we have a great panel with some of the most distinguished businesspeople in the world let me start with someone that you know really well that i think is almost a neighbor of you in mal a in in florida mr steve schwarzman chairman ceo and cofounder of blackstone group so steve floor is yours mr schwarzman well mr president the president hello steve mr schwarzman i m sure the crown prince of saudi arabia will be really glad you gave this speech today laughter the president i hope so mr schwarzman you ve had the busiest four days that anybody can imagine and congratulations for that and my question is is about some of the things i ve observed here at davos it s a terrific forum i ve met lots of people as usual i think i ve been here years and a lot of the european businesspeople have expressed enormous frustration with the regulatory regime in the eu and they attribute slower growth rates here because of numerous factors but especially because of regulations and you ve taken a completely different approach in this area and if you could explain the theory of what you re doing how you re going to do it and what you expect the outcome to be i d appreciate it the president well thank you very much and congratulations steve you re a friend of mine but on a great career you have had an amazing career and continues so i just want to congratulate you very inspirational to a lot of people i want to talk about the eu because you mentioned specifically that i ve also had a lot of friends and leaders of countries i ve gotten to know them all my first term and a little bit during this period of four years and know them well like them a lot but they re very frustrated because of the time everything seems to take to get approved environmental impact statements for things that you shouldn t even have to do that and many many other ways that it takes and i m going to give you a quick little example i w in the private life my beautiful private life before i had all these things happening the world is a little different i had a nice simple life you knew that but when i had that simple life i did projects and i had a big project in ireland and it had to get approval on something that would have made it even better and i got the approval from ireland in a period of a week and it was a very very very efficient good approval and they informed me though the problem is you re going to have to get it from the eu and we think that ll take five to six years and i said you have to be kidding and this was before politics and i said wait a minute it s not that important i don t want to go five or six years but it would have been a big investment it would have been nice and it would have been good for the project and i sent the people to the eu to see if they could speed it up and basically it was a five or six year wait just to get a simple approval that ireland gave me in a period of literally not much more than a week and i realized right then that was the first time i really was involved with the eu but i realized right then that s a problem and i didn t even bother applying to do it and or if i did i pulled it very quickly i don t wa i have to be very accurate because i don t want to be criticized he did apply actually no i want to be very accurate so i don t think i did but if i did i pulled it very quickly it was just something you you couldn t wait five years or six years to get an approval so a lot of in a very big business sense a lot of people are are claiming that s the problem from the standpoint of america the eu treats us very very unfairly very badly they have a large tax that we know about and a vat tax and it s a very substantial one they don t take our far essentially don t take our farm products and they don t take our cars yet they send cars to us by the millions they put tariffs on things that we want to do like for instance i think they actually in terms of these are noneconomic or nonmonetary tariffs and and those are very bad and they make it very difficult to bring products into europe and yet they expect to be selling and they do sell their products in the united states so we have you know hundreds of billions of dollars of deficits with the eu and nobody is happy with it and we re going to do something about it but nobody is happy with it so i think the eu has to speed up their process friends of mine that are in some of the nations within the eu great people they they want to be able to compete better and you can t compete when you can t get go through the approval process fast there s no reason why it can t go faster so you know i m i m trying to be constructive because i love europe i love the countries of europe but the process is a very cumbersome one and th and they do treat the united states of america very very unfairly with the vat taxes and all of the other taxes they impose one other just to finish up i got a call from the head of a major airline one of the biggest airlines in the world and he said sir could you help us what landing in europe is brutal they charge us fees for everything and it s so unfair i said how does it compare to china he said it s it s much worse and the other thing as you know they took court cases with apple and they supposedly won a case that most people didn t think was much of a case they won $ or $ billion from apple they won billions from google i think they re after facebook for billions and billions these are american companies whether you like them or not they re they re american companies and they shouldn t be doing that and that s as far as i m concerned it s a form of taxation so we have some very big complaints with the eu thank you mr brende tha thank you very much mr president we ll now go to one of your friends in the eu patrick pouyanné he s the chairman and ceo of totalenergies i guess you have a question ready patrick for the president mr pouyanné mr president as we understand energy is at the top of your agenda and it s an honor for me to represent the energy industry tonight in this panel totalenergies is indeed the fourth largest oil and gas and electricity company in the world i will not ask you a question about the oil price it s quite clear what you expect from us i will more go to gas more and we our company is the largest number one exporter lng from the u s company we are a strong contributor to and we invest in mammoth lng projects in texas $ billion it s far from $ but it s $ billion and we contribute with that to security of supply to europe as we export this lng to europe some experts fear that if there are too many projects developed in the u s on lng this could have an inflat inflationary impact on the u s domestic gas price and they recommend a pause on these projects i would ask you the following question what are your views on about such a pause on investments on lng in the u s what would happen if you would observe an increased domestic gas price because of these exports and final question which is important for europe would you agree to guarantee security of supplies of u s lng to europe the president well on the last part of your question yes i would i would make sure that you get it if we make a deal we make a deal you ll get it because a lot of people do have that problem they make a deal and then it can t get supplied because of war type problems and other problems so we would absolutely do that lng is very interesting because when i took office for the first term one of the first things i looked at was two there were two very massive plants in louisiana a state that has been very good to me i won it by many many points and i felt strongly indebted to it actually and they said there are two plants that have been under environmental consideration for more than years and they were costing as you say you know how expensive those plants are but they were costing like $ billion and i think $ or $ billion but they couldn t get their permits it was they were in review for years many many years like a decade or more and i said so ridiculous i know so much about that because in the construction industry i had to go through it too but i got good at it after a while but i i went i saw the projects and you re talking about a total investment of $ to $ billion and it looked like it was going to end they couldn t get their permits and i got them done in less than a week it was done completed in fact when they called them to announce that it was done the countries largely countries japan was involved and and another country and some very big investors they couldn t believe it they actually couldn t believe it and i said just do yourself one favor don t pay any consultants because the only one that got it done was me i got it done because it was the right thing to do for the u s and for the world but the consultants had nothing to do with it you know the consultants go in and they say give us millions of dollars because trump did it nobody called me about it i just heard it was a problem for years and i got it done because it was the right thing to do for the u s and the right thing to do for beyond it had to do with energy very important so i think it s very important i think the the you know i disagree with one i think the more that you do the lower the price is going to go and what i d like to see is rapid approvals we re going to give very rapid approvals in the united states like with the ai plants talking to many people want to build them that s going to be a very big thing we re going to build electric generating facilities they are going to build i m going to get them the approval under emergency declaration i can get the approvals done myself without having to go through years of waiting and the big problem is we need double the energy we currently have in the united states can you imagine for ai to really be as big as we want to have it because it s a very competitive it will be very competitive with china and others so i m going to give emergency declarations so that they can start building them almost immediately and i m i m i think it was largely my idea because nobody thought this was possible it wasn t that they were not smart because they re the smartest but i told them that what i want you to do is build your electric generating plant right next to your plant as a separate building connected and they said wow you re kidding and i said no no i m not kidding you don t have to hook into the grid which is old and you know could be taken out if it s taken out they wouldn t have any way to get any electricity so we are going to allow them to go on a very rapid bas basis to build their plant build the electric generating plant they can fuel it with anything they want and they may have coal as a backup good clean coal you know if there were a problem with a with a pipe coming in as an example you re going with gas oil or gas and a pipe gets blown up or for some reason doesn t work there are some companies in the u s that have coal sitting right by the plant so that if there s an emergency they can go to that short term basis and use our very clean coal so that s something else that a lot of people didn t even know about but nothing can destroy coal not the weather not a bomb nothing it might make it a little smaller might make it a little different shape but coal is very strong as a backup it s a great backup to have that facility and it wouldn t cost much more more money and we have more coal than anybody we also have more oil and gas than anybody so we re going to make it so that the plants will have their own electric generating facilities attached right to their plant they don t have to worry about a utility they don t have to worry about anything and we re going to get very rapid approvals mr brende thank you thank you so much mr president we ll now go to another ceo that you know very well brian moynihan the ceo and chair of bank of america mr moynihan good afternoon mr president and congratulations an obviously eventful week for you and your family if you remember five years ago you came here and we walked among ceos from all over the world and you engaged with them about your policies and your procedures this year you re not here and yet this week was eventful from the orders that you mentioned earlier literally a wave of orders coming out on immigration on trade and many other matters and so as a representative of the united states here we got a lot of questions about what does all this mean and how would the president square this with his clear focus on growth prosperity market gro stock market growth a good bond market and bringing down prices so how do you think about the impact of all these orders and how fast they come out and how you re going to balance them with that scorecard of being successful on both contan continuing gdp growth bringing down inflation and also having a good stock price appreciation for the american citizen the president well i think it s going to actually bring down inflation it s going to bring up jobs we re going to have a lot of jobs we re going to have a lot of companies moving in you know brian we re at percent it was at percent and i got it down to percent the corporate tax and it was actually if you look at state and city it was in many cases much higher than percent i got it down to percent and now we re going to bring it down from to percent if this is a big if if you make your product in the u s so we re going to have the lowest just about the lowest rate it will be the is on the low side worldwide the is about as low as it gets and by far the lowest of a large country a large you know rich powerful country by far not even a contest so we re going to bring it down to percent if you make your product in the usa so that s going to create a a tremendous buzz we re also probably going back to the one year deduction where we deduct you know we we did that originally and that was amazing what the impact that that had the one year deduction which built up over a period of time and then it expires but we re going to go back to that when we do the renewal of the trump tax plan we have to get democrats to approve it but you know if the democrats didn t approve it i don t know how they can survive with about a percent tax increase because that s what it would be and so i think they re going to b w we ve been working along with them pretty well i think it s very hard for a political group to say let s charge people percent more so i think we re in good shape but we re actually doing a reduction for business and small businesses where you re going to b bring it down to percent which is really something and by the way speaking of you and you ve done a fantastic job but i hope you start opening your bank to conservatives because many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank and that included a place called bank of america this conserve they don t take conservative business and i don t know if the regulators mandated that because of biden or what but you and jamie and everybody i hope you re going to open your banks to conservatives because what you re doing is wrong mr moynihan mr president mr brende inaudible mr moynihan i ll say that your friend gianni was said hello told me tell you hello and we look forward to sponsoring the world cup when it comes both this summer for the club and next year so thank you for getting that for the united states the president thank you very much brian mr brende thank you mr president we ll now go to ana botín she s the executive chairman of banco santander one of the big european banks and also in the u s so ana ms botín mr president congratulations on a historic victory the president thank you ms botín i believe you don t know me as well as my fellow panelists so a few words santander is one of the largest banks in the world by number of customers million that s more than my friend brian or my friend jamie have laughter the president wow ms botín and those applause mr moynihan if they fix the regulation inaudible ms botín that s coming that s coming mr brende that was cheeky laughter ms botín we are we are a big investor in the united states we have many million customer employees we re one of the largest auto lenders and we recently launched a fully digital bank called openbank we strongly believe banks have a pivotal role in the economy and we can accelerate growth and help many more customers that s what we do in the united states so as brian pointed out we very much welcome your focus on deregulation and reducing bureaucracy so my question is what are your priorities in this regard and how fast is this going to happen thank you very much the president well i think it s going to thank you and congratulations i know very much about your bank and you ve done a fantastic job congratulations we are going to move very quickly we ve moved very quickly we ve done things in the last three days that nobody thought were possible to do in years and it s all taken it s all taken effect it s going to have a huge impact on the economy a huge positive impact money was being wasted on crazy things i mean the green new deal was such a total disgrace what what how that was perpetrated and it was conceived of by people that were average students less than average students i might add and never even took a course in energy or the environment it was just a game remember the world was going to end in years remember that well the years has come and gone it was going to end it was going to all foam into earth but you know the time has come the these people and they they really they really scared the democrats large i can t say the republicans republicans maybe could have fought harder to stop it but it s been a tremendous waste of a tremendous waste of money you know during my four years we had the cleanest air we had the cleanest water and yet we had the most productive economy in the history of our country we had the most productive economy until covid came we had the most productive in the history of our country by far and and actually you could look worldwide we we re we were beating everybody from china to everybody else so and we think we really now with what we have learned and all of the other things that have taken place we think we can even far surpass that a actually far far surpass it but we do one thing we re going to be demanding is we re going to be demanding respect from other nations canada we have a tremendous deficit with canada we re not going to have that anymore we can t do it it s it s i don t know if it s good for them as you probably know i say you can always become a state and if you re a state we won t have a deficit we won t have to tariff you et cetera et cetera but canada has been very tough to deal with over the years and it s not fair that we should have a $ billion or $ billion deficit we don t need them to make our cars and they make a lot of them we don t need their lumber because we have our own forests et cetera et cetera we don t need their oil and gas we have our we have more than anybody so you know just as an example with mexico we re dealing with mexico i think very well and we re just you know w we just want to be treated fairly with other nations because there s hardly a nation in the world and i blame this on us and i blame it on politicians that for some reason and probably mostly it s stupidity but you could also say other reasons but mostly stupidity they ve allowed other nations to take advantage of the u s and w we can t allow that to happen anymore you know we have debt it s a very small debt when you compare it to value the value of the assets that we have but we don t want to do that we want to just have debt be obliterated and we ll be able to do that fairly rapidly and a lot of good things are going to happen and and honestly good things are going to happen for the world and good things are going to happen for the people that are dealing with us allies and beyond allies one thing very important i really would like to be able to meet with president putin soon and get that war end ended and and that s not from the standpoint of economy or anything else it s from the standpoint of millions of lives are being wasted beautiful young people are being shot in the battlefield you know the bullet a very flat land as i said and the bullet goes there s no there s no hiding and a bullet the only thing going to stop the bullet is a human body and you have to see i ve seen pictures of what s taken place it s a carnage and we really have to stop that war that war is horrible and i m not talking economy i m not talking economics i m not talking about natural resource i m just talking about there s so many young people being killed in this war and that s not including the people that have been killed as the cities are being you know knocked down building by building so we really should get that stopped likewise in the middle east i think we ve made a lot of progress in the middle east and i think that s going to that s going to come along pretty well thank you very much mr brende thank you mr president we know that most consequential relationship in the world is between the u s and china u s percent of the global economy china close to that s almost half of the global gdp and we know that you called president xi jinping last friday we heard that you had a good discussion how do you see the relationship between the u s and china in the next four years under your leadership the president he called me but i see it very good i think that we re going to have a very good relationship all we want is fairness we just want a level playing field we don t want to take advantage we ve been having massive deficits with china biden allowed it to get out of hand he s $ trillion deficit it s ridiculous and it s just an unfair relationship and we have to make it just fair we don t have to make it phenomenal we have to make it a fair relationship right now it s not a fair relationship the deficit is massive as it is with other countries a lot of asian countries actually but we have deficits that are very big and we can t keep doing that so we re not going to keep doing that but i like president xi very much i ve always liked him we always had a very good relationship it was very strained with covid coming out of wuhan obviously that strained it i m sure it strained it with a lot of people but that strained our relationship but we always had a great relationship i would say and we look forward to doing very well with china and getting along with china hopefully china can help us stop the war with in particular russia ukraine and they have a great deal of power over that situation and we ll work with them and i mentioned that with during our phone conversation with president xi and hopefully we could work together and get that stopped we d like to see denuclearization in fact with president putin prior to a an election result which was frankly ridiculous we were talking about denuclearization of our two countries and china would have come along china has a a much smaller right now nuclear armament than us or field than us but they re they re going to be catching it at some point over the next four or five years and i will tell you that president putin really liked the idea of of cutting way back on nuclear and i think the rest of the world we would have gotten them to follow and china would have come along too china also liked it tremendous amounts of money are being spent on nuclear and the destructive capability is something that we don t even want to talk about today because you don t want to hear it it s too depressing so we want to see if we can denuclearize and i think that s very possible and i can tell you that president putin wanted to do it he and i wanted to do it we had a good conversation with china they would have been involved and that would have been an unbelievable thing for the planet and i hope mr brende mr president when you re the president it can be started up again mr brende back here in davos next year will will there be then a peace agreement with with ukraine and russia by then the president well you re going to have to ask russia ukraine is ready to to make a deal just so you understand this is a war that should have never started if i were president it would never have started this is a war that should have never ever been started and and it wasn t started during my there was never even talk about it i knew that it was the apple of president putin s eye but i also knew that there was no way he was going in and he wasn t going to go in and then when i was out bad things happened bad things were said a lot of stupidity all around and you end up with what you have now you have all these bombed out cities they look like demolition sites with many people killed i think the the thing that you ll see about ukraine is that far far more people have died than is being reported and i ve seen that but far far more people have died when you look at a city that s become a demolition site where big buildings have been collapsed by missiles hitting them and everything else and they say one person was slightly injured no no many people were killed those are big buildings i was surprised at how that was my business these are buildings that go two and three blocks long they re stories high they re big powerful buildings then they were knocked down and there were a lot of people in those buildings they had announced that two people were injured that s not true so i think you re going to find that there were many more people killed in ukraine and the ukraine war than anybody has any idea but if you look now so many of the the people being killed are soldiers just facing each other with guns rifles and drones the new form of warfare drones and it s a very sad thing to see and when you see pictures of the fields that i see nobody wants to see it you ll never be the same mr brende thank you very much mr president on behalf of all the participants here in davos we really really underline that joining us the third day in your presidency live taking questions here it s so appreciated and we are already ready for receiving you next year in person so thank you very much and all the best from davos applause the president thank you thank you very much thank you applause na

12:33 P.M. EDT
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Hello, everybody.  It’s great to be with a friend of mine, who was prime minister of the Netherlands, so I got to know him very well.  We had a great relationship always.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Absolutely.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Mark Rutte.  Now he’s secretary general of NATO and doing a fantastic job.  Everybody — every report I’ve gotten is what a great job he did.  And I’m not at all surprised when I hear it.  We had to support him, and we supported him as soon as I heard the name.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Thank you.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  But he was a fantastic prime minister, and he’s doing a fantastic job. An even tougher job.  Which is tougher: being the prime minister of Netherlands or?
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  This job is quite tough.  Yeah.  (Laughter.)
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I would think this is a little tougher.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  But — but Dutch politics is also brutal.  So — (laughter).
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.  But this is pretty tough.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  But you’re doing good.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Thank you.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  We’re going to be discussing a lot of things.  Obviously, we’ll be discussing what’s happening with respect to Ukraine and Russia.
At this moment, we have people talking in Russia.  We have representatives over there — Steve Witkoff and others.  And they’re in very serious discussions.  As you know, Ukraine has agreed, subject to this — what’s happening today — to a complete ceasefire, and we hope Russia will do the same.
Thousands of people are being killed — young people, usually, mostly young people.  We were just talking about it.  Thousands of young people are being killed a week, and we want to see that stop.  And they’re not Americans, and they’re not from the Netherlands for the most part.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  No.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  They’re not from — they’re from Russia and they’re from Ukraine, but they’re people.  And I think everybody feels the same way.  We want it to stop.
It’s also a tremendous cost to the United States and to other countries.  And it’s something that would have never happened if I were president, and it makes me very angry to see that it did happen.  But it happened, and we have to stop it.
And Mark has done some really good work over the last week.  We’ve been working together, and he’s done some really good work.  So, I’m very happy about that.
We’ll also be talking about trade and various other things, and I think we’ll have a very, very strong day.  We’re going to have lunch afterwards.  That’ll go.  And then we’ll see you all later.
But, Mark, would you like to say something?
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.  First of all, thank you so much, Mr. President, dear Donald, again for hosting me and — but also for taking time in Florida a couple of weeks after you —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Right.  That’s right.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  — you were reelected.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  That’s right.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  And, of course, our phone call a couple of weeks ago.  And I must say, Trump 45 — you basically — you originated the fact that in Europe we are now spending, when you take it to aggregate, $700 billion more on defense —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  — than when you came in office in 2016 — in 2017.
But that was Trump 45.  But when look at Trump 47 —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Going to be hard to top.  (Laughter.)
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  — what happened the last couple of weeks is really staggering.  The Europeans committing to a package of $800 billion defense spending.  The Germans now —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  — potentially up to half a trillion extra in defense spending.  And then, of course, you have Keir Starmer here, the British prime minister, and others all committing to much higher defense spending.
They’re not there.  We need to do more.  But I really want to work together with you in a run-up to The Hague summit to make sure that we will have a NATO which is really reinvigorated under your leadership.  And we are getting there.
We also discussed defense production, because we need to produce more weaponry.  We are not doing enough — not in the U.S., not in Europe.  And we are lagging behind when you compare to the Russians and the Chinese.  And you have a huge defense industrial base, Europeans buying mo- — four times more here than the other — the other way around, which is good, because you have a strong defense industry.
But we need to do more there to make sure that we ramp up production and kill the red tape.  So, I would love to work with you on that.
And finally, Ukraine — you broke the deadlock.  As you said, all the killing, the young people dying, cities getting destroyed.  The fact that you did that, that you started the dialogue with the Russians and the successful talks in Saudi Arabia now with the Ukrainians — I really want to commend you for this.
So, well, The Hague is my hometown.  I’d love to host you there in the summer and work together to make sure that —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  We’ll do that.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  — that will be a splash, a real success, projecting American power on the world stage.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  What Mark is saying is: When I first went to NATO, my first meeting, I noticed that very few people were paying.  And if they were, they weren’t paying their fair share.  There were only seven countries that were paying what they were supposed to be paying, which was —
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  It’s even worse, there were three.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  That’s even worse.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  It could be even worse.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  But there were just very few countries that were paying.  And even the paying, it was at 2 percent, which is too low.  It should be higher.  It should be quite a bit higher.
But you had Poland and I remember Poland was actually paying a little bit more than they were supposed to, which I was very impressed with.  And they’ve been actually terrific and some of the others.  But most of them weren’t paying or they were paying very little.
And I didn’t think it was appropriate to bring it up there, but I said, “It’s going to be brought up at my next meeting.”  And my next meeting — you know, the first meeting, you want to give them a little break.  The second meeting, it began.
And I was able to raise —
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  You did.  (Laughs.)
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  — hundreds of billions of dollars.  I just said, “We’re not going to be involved with you if you’re not going to pay.”  And the money started pouring in.  And NATO became much stronger because of my actions and working along with a lot of people, including Mark.
But they would not pay for other presidents.  I don’t think other presidents even knew that they weren’t paid.  I asked, first question, “Has everybody paid up?”  And literally, I mean, they showed — they told me seven.  You could be right.  It could be three.  But — that makes it even worse — but they just weren’t paying.
And I said, “No, I won’t protect if you’re not paying.  If you’re delinquent or if the money isn’t paid, why would we do that?”
And as soon as I said that, got a little hit from the press, because they said, “Oh, gee, that’s not very nice.”  But if you said the other, nobody would have paid.  And the money started coming in by the billions.
And, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars flowed into NATO, and NATO became strong.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  And you remember that.  And your predecessor, who I thought was a very good man actually.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Absolutely.  Jens Stoltenberg.  He sends his best greetings.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.  He was terrific.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Stoltenberg, secretary general.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Great man.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  And he made the statement that when Trump came in, the money started coming in like we never saw before.  Hundreds of billions — it was actually probably close to $600 billion came in.  And NATO became strong from that standpoint.
And now, we have to use it wisely.  And we have to get this war over with.  And you’ll be back to a normal — much more normal life.
And maybe we’re close.  We’re getting words that things are going okay in Russia, and it doesn’t mean anything until we hear what the final outcome is.
But they have very serious discussions going on right now with President Putin and others.  And hopefully, they all want to end this nightmare.  It’s a nightmare.  It’s a horrible thing, when you look.  I get pictures every week.  They give me the pictures of the battlefield, which I almost don’t want to see.  It’s so horrible to see.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  It’s so terrible.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Young people laying — arms and legs and heads laying all over the field.  It’s the most terrible thing that you’ll ever see.
And it’s got to stop.  These are young people with mothers and fathers and sisters and brothers and friends, and it’s got to stop.
So, we hopefully are going to be in a good position sometime today to have a good idea.  We’ll have — we know where we are with Ukraine, and we are getting good signals outside of Russia as to where we are with Russia, and hopefully they’ll do the right thing.
It’s a really — humanity — we’re talking about humanity.  We’re not talking about the money.  But then you add the money to it, and, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars is being spent and, really, wasted so unnecessarily.  It should have never happened.
So, it’s an honor to have you here.  They picked a great gentleman.  I’ll tell you, that was — I was so happy to hear, because you had somebody — Stoltenberg was really good.  And you have somebody that’s going to do an incredible job.  And I was so much in favor of you, you have no idea.
They had another person that I did not like.  (Laughter.)  I was not happy.  And I think I kept him from — you know what I’m talking about.  I said, “This is the right man to do it.”  And he really did.  He was a great prime minister of the Netherlands.  He did a great job.  And that’s what he’s doing right now.
So, thank you, everybody, for being here.  And very great honor to have you.  And we even have some of our great energy people here today, right?  We have the governor, and we have Chris.  You know Chris.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.  Absolutely.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  He’s supposed to be the most talented man in the world of energy, according to the governor.  (Laughter.)  So, I don’t know if he’s right.
And we have — General, you’ve been fantastic.  Thank you very much.
And we have a lot of good people that won’t be so much involved with this, but they wanted to see what was happening.  It’s become a little bit of a show — (laughter) — but they wanted to see what was happening.  And I think a lot of good things are happening.
So, with that, if anybody would have a question.
(Cross-talk.)
Q    Mr. President, o- — on Russia.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Please, go ahead.
Q    Vlad- —     Q    Sorry.  Sorry, Mary.  Steve Witkoff’s trip to Moscow, you spoke about it.  What sort of agreement do you hope he comes away from there with?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, we’d like to see a ceasefire from Russia.  And we have, you know, not been working in the dark.  We’ve been discussing with Ukraine land and pieces of land that would be kept and lost and all of the other elements of a final agreement.
There’s a power plant involved — you know, a very big power plant involved.  Who’s going to get the power plant and who’s going to get this and that.  And so, you know, it’s not an easy process.
But phase one is the ceasefire.  A lot of the individual subjects have been discussed, though.  You know, we’ve been discussing concepts of land, because you don’t want to waste time with the ceasefire if it’s not going to mean anything.  So, we’re saying, “Look, this is what you can get.  This is what you can’t get.”
They discussed NATO and being in NATO, and everybody knows what the answer to that is.  They’ve known that answer for 40 years, in all fairness.
So, a lot of the details of a final agreement have actually been discussed.  Now we’re going to see whether or not Russia is there, and if they’re not, it’ll be a very disappointing moment for the world.
Yeah.
Q    And Vladimir Putin just said he is open to a ceasefire, but he does still have some concerns.  He suggested that you two should speak directly.  Do you have plans to speak to him soon?  If so, when?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I would.  Yeah, sure.
Q    And are you confident you can get this across the finish line?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Sure.  He did say that today.  It was a very promising statement, because other people are saying different things, and you don’t know if they have anything to really — if they have any meaning, or I don’t know.  I think some of them were making statements.  I don’t think they have anything to do with it.
No, he put out a very promising statement, but it wasn’t complete.  And, yeah, I’d love to meet with him or talk to him, but we have to get it over with fast.  You know, every day people are being killed.  It’s not like — as we sit here, two people will be killed.  Think of it.  Two people are going to be killed during this little period of time.      Thousands of people a week are dying, so we really don’t have very much time.  We have to make this fast.  It shouldn’t be very complicated.
(Cross-talk.)
Yes.
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  A representative of Canada, the finance minister, are in town and will meet members of your administration during the day.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Sure.  Yeah.
Q    Any chances that you will ban on the tariffs on aluminum and — and the — the ones that are planned for April 2nd?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  No.
Q    You are not going to change your mind?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, I’m not.  Look, we’ve been ripped off for years, and we’re not going to be ripped off anymore.  No, I’m not going to bend at all on aluminum or steel or cars.  We’re not going to bend.  We’ve been ripped off as a country for many, many years.  We’ve been subjected to costs that we shouldn’t be subjected to.
In the case of Canada, we’re spending $200 billion a year to subsidize Canada.  I love Canada.  I love the people of Canada. I have many friends in Canada.  “The Great One,” Wayne Gretzky, the great.  Hey, how good is Wayne Gretzky?  He’s the Great One.
But we have — I know many people from Canada that are good friends of mine.  But, you know, the United States can’t subsidize a country for $200 billion a year.  We don’t need their cars.  We don’t need their energy.  We don’t need their lumber.  We don’t need anything that they give.
We do it because we want to be helpful, but it comes a point when you just can’t do that.  You have to run your own country.  And to be honest with you, Canada only works as a state.  We don’t need anything they have.  As a state, it would be one of the great states anywhere.
This would be the most incredible country visually.  If you look at a map, they drew an artificial line right through it — between Canada and the U.S.  Just a straight artificial line.  Somebody did it a long time ago — many, many decades ago — and makes no sense.
It’s so perfect as a great and cherished state, keeping “O Canada,” the national anthem.  I love it.  I think it’s great.  Keep it, but it’ll be for the state.  One of our greatest states.  Maybe our greatest state.
But why should we subsidize another country for $200 billion?  It costs us $200 billion a year.  And again, we don’t need their lumber.  We don’t need their energy.  We have more than they do.  We don’t need anything.  We don’t need their cars.  I’d much rather make the cars here.
And there’s not a thing that we need.  Now, there’ll be a little disruption, but it won’t be very long.  But they need us.  We really don’t need them.  And we have to do this.  I’m sorry, we have to do this.
Yes.
Q    Mr. President —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.
Q    — you have made it very clear that NATO needs to step up, although great progress —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.
Q    — has been made in your first mandate.  How do you envision this new transatlantic —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Are you talking about NATO stepping up?
Q    Yes.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, NATO is stepping up through this man. This man is a man that only knows how to step up.  And we have the same goal in mind: We want the war ended.  And he’s doing his job.  He only knows how to do a good job.  That’s one thing.  That’s why I fought for him to get that job —
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Thank you so much.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  — because they had some other candidates that I’ll tell you would not have done a very good job.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  I need this part of the — of the movie for my family.  (Laughter.)
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  That’s right.  That’s right.  We’ll get you a clip.      SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.  Exactly.  (Laughs.)     PRESIDENT TRUMP:  We’re going to get him a clip of that — of that little last essay.  But the rest of the statements he doesn’t care about.
Q    Sir, how does this new transatlantic cooperation — how do you envision it?  What is it going to look like?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, we have — that’s one thing.  I mean, you know, we’re the other side of the ocean, and they’re right there.  And yet, we’re in for $350 billion because of Biden, and they’re in for $100 billion.  So, it’s a big difference, and it’s unfair.
And I said, “You have to equalize.”  They should equalize.  They should have — it should have never happened, where Biden just gave his money away.
Now, as you know, we have an agreement with Ukraine on the rare earths and other things, and that’ll get us
something back — a lot back.  It’ll get us our money back.  We’re not doing it for that, though.  We’re doing — I’m just doing this to get the war stopped.  I’m doing it, really, to save lives.
But, at the same time, we were treated very unfairly, as we always are by every country.  And we’re in for very substantially more than the European nations are in for, and that shouldn’t be.
You know, they’re much more affected by it than we are, because we do have an ocean in between.
But I don’t know.  I think good things are going to happen.  I really do.  I think good things are going to happen.
I do say — we were talking before, and Mark was very nice.  He said, “If you wouldn’t get involved, there would be” — you’d just be going on.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  This thing would have gone on for a long time.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Breaking a deadlock.  It was crucial.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, we broke a deadlock.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  We did break a deadlock.  I hope it’s meaningful.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes, did you have one?
Q    Mr. President —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, please.
Q    Yes, sir.  Thank you, Mr. President.  Amanda Head with Just the News.  On the southern border, you’ve got DHS and ICE, who are reporting that there was a little bit of fudging of numbers during the Biden administration —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.
Q    — on both the catch and the release side with respect to reporting the number of illegals coming into the country who were released.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  They cheated on the numbers.  They were — the numbers were — I love that question.
Q    Right.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Who are you with?
Q    Just the News.  Amanda Head.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Very nice.  That’s good.  That’s good.
Q    Do you know how many of those are criminal illegal aliens?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Many of them.
Q    And Biden is out of office —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:   Yeah.
Q    — Alejandro Mayorkas.  Who gets held accountable?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, Biden fudged the numbers.  The numbers were totally fake, and he gave fake numbers.  I knew they were fake.  Everybody knew they were fake, but now it came out.  And terrible what — what they did.  That administration was a horror show for this country.
Q    Can you hold anyone accountable?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I don’t know.  They gave phony numbers, and phony numbers are a very bad thing to give.  But I’m not sure about that.  I don’t know how it would play.  We want to get it straightened out.
We have — we’re after many, many bad people that were let into our country.  And Kristi Noem and my friend Homan — how good is Tom Homan doing, right?  And they’re after them.  And they — I mean, you see: They’re taking them out in record numbers.  Gang members, gang leaders, drug dealers.
This is a problem the Netherlands does not have.  The Netherlands never had this problem.  If you’d like to take —
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  We have a few drug- — drug dealers, I’m afraid.  (Laughter.)
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I could deliver some people.  I could deliver some nice people to the Netherlands if you’d like.  (Laughter.)
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  I’m not sure.  (Laughs.)
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, what he did to this country, letting 21 million people flow through an open border — many of those people were hard criminals from prisons and jails, from mental institutions, and I always say “insane asylums,” because they were seriously deranged.  And they’re here from not South America, from all over the world.  From South America, but from all over the world.  And it’s so sad.
You’d say, “Why would anybody do this?  Why?”
Yeah, go ahead.
Q    And — and one more.  There’s some new internal Democrat polling that doesn’t look great for Democrats, but it also has 54 percent unfavorability for Republicans in swing states and battlegrounds for the midterms.  Do you consider those voters cap- — capturable for — for Republicans?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, well, we did — you know, I won every swing state, as you know, by a lot, and I won the popular vote by a lot, and we won the counties.  If you look at the counties and district plan, we had 2,725, and they had 501.  That’s a real — that’s why the map is all red.  So, we had a great thing.
Yeah, I think winning from the Democrats — I saw — if you looked the other night, I made a speech, and I introduced two young ladies who were killed.  Two killed.  Viciously, violently killed.  Young.  Unbelievable.  Both outstanding people.  They were killed by illegal aliens.  And the Democrats wouldn’t get up and applaud.  The mothers were, I mean, inconsolable.  They were crying, and everybody was crying.  The Democrats sat there with stone faces.  They didn’t clap, they didn’t stand, they didn’t do anything.
We had a young man with very serious cancer, wanted to — his dream is to be with the police department someday, and he was introduced.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  That was very touching.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  They didn’t even clap.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah, I saw it.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I mean, they were disgusting.  Frankly, they were disgusting.  There’s something wrong with them.  They’re deranged.  They’re deranged.  Like Jack Smith, they’re deranged people.
And I never saw anything like it.  I’m standing up, and I introduce the mother and the parents of these two young girls that were just recently, essentially, killed.  Violently killed.  And the Democrats are like this.  It’s so sad.
And I saw this morning where — one of them is pretty well-known — one is arguing, fighting like crazy over men being able to play in women’s sports.  I said, “Yeah, I thought that was tried.”  I thought that was about a 95 — I think it’s a 95 percent issue.
But, in a way, I want them to keep doing it, because I don’t think they can win a race.  I mean — and I tell the Republicans, I said, “Don’t bring that subject up, because there’s no election right now.  But about a week before the election, bring it up, because you can’t lose.”
And everything is “transgender this, transgender that.”  You know, they have bad politics.
But one thing: They stick together.  You know?
I wish — and the Republicans stick together, mostly, but we have a couple that are grandstanders.  You know, you always have grandstanders in life.
But the Democrats, they don’t seem — they have grandstanders, but when it comes to a vote, they do stick together, right?
VICE PRESIDENT VANCE:  They get in line.  Yes, sir.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  So.
Q    It seems like they’ll stick together on the shutdown.  Will that hurt Democrats going into midterms?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, if they do a shutdown and, ultimately, that might lead to very, very high taxes, because we’re talking about a shutdown.  We’re talking about getting to work immediately on the greatest tax bill ever passed.  That was the one we did.  It’s a renewal, and it’s an addition to it.  And we’re going to cut people’s taxes.
And if we don’t open, the Democrats are stopping all of these good things that we’re providing.  We’re providing the greatest package of benefits that this country has ever provided.
The biggest part of that’s going to be tax cuts for the middle class and for businesses, small businesses, employers — people that hire people and jobs.
And if it’s shut down, it’s only going to be — if there’s a shutdown, it’s only because of the Democrats, and they would really be taking away a lot from our country and from the people of our country.
Q    Mr. President, on — on tariffs.  You made clear you’re not backing down from this, but many American small-business owners say they are concerned that these tariffs are going to hurt them.  What’s your message to them?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  They’re going to be so much richer than they are right now.
And we have many — yesterday, General Motors was in.  They want to invest $60 billion.  The people from Facebook were in yesterday.  They’re going to invest $60 billion by the end of the year.  Other people are talking about numbers.
Apple, as you know, a few days ago, announced $500 billion investment.  They’re going to build their plants in the United States, which, as you know, almost all of their plants are in China.  Now they’re building in the United States.
Look, the reason is two things.  Number one, the election. November 5th.  And the other thing is tariffs.  I think, probably, in that order.
But Tim Cook came in and he announced 500 — think of it, $500 billion, not million.  Five hundred million is a lot, when you think about it, right?  But —
VICE PRESIDENT VANCE:  Yes, sir.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I would have been happy with $500 million.  But it’s $500 billion investment by Apple in the United States, and that’s because of the election result and it’s because of the tariffs and the tax incentives too.  You know, tariffs and tax incentives.  And I’ve never seen anything like it.
We have plants going up now in Indiana.  We have plants going up in Michigan.  A lot of plants going to be planned from — I’m trying to steer them to Michigan, because Michigan got so badly beaten by, you know, what happened with Europe.
You know, if you look at Europe. Take a look at the EU.  We’re not allowed to sell cars there.  It’s prohibitive because of their policies, and also their nonmonetary tariffs.  They put obstacles in your way that you can do nothing about.
But if you take a look at what happens — so, we sell no cars to Europe — I mean, virtually no cars — and they sell millions of cars to us.  They don’t take our agriculture.  We take their agriculture. It’s like a one-way street with them.
The European Union is very, very nasty.
They sue our companies.  Apple was forced to pay $16 billion on a case that — very much like my cases that I won.  They shouldn’t have been even cases.  But we felt they had no case, and they ended up having an extremely favorable judge and decision.
But they’re suing Google, they’re suing Facebook, they’re suing all of these companies, and they’re taking billions of dollars out of American companies, many more than the ones I just mentioned.  And I guess they’re using it to run Europe or something.  I don’t know what they’re using it for.
But they treat us very badly.  China obviously treats this very badly.  Almost everybody does.  And I blame past presidents, to be honest.
Because when I was president, I — we received, so far, about $700 billion from China, over the years, on the tariffs that I put in.  No other president got 10 cents from China.  And that was only beginning.  Except for COVID, it would have — I would have been able to finish the process.  But we had to fight the COVID thing, and we did really well with it.  But we had to fight.
And then we had actually — as you remember, Mark, we actually handed over the stock market.  It was higher than just previous to COVID coming in, which was sort of a miracle, frankly.  We did a good job.
But the tariffs are very important.  And I think the psychology — there’s great spirit.  When Mark came in, he said, “Congratulations.  There’s a whole new spirit.  There’s a whole new light over this country, and really over the world” —
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  — because you have somebody that — a whole group of people, really, because I talk about this whole group, that we know what we’re doing.  And a lot of great things are happening.
But I’ve never seen investment like this.  Trillions of dollars is being invested in the United States now that would have never — our country could have failed.  Another four years of this, what happened in the last four years, our country would have been a crime-ridden mess.
And I don’t know if you noticed — a little thing, they call it, but it’s not a little thing if you don’t have — if you like eggs and you don’t have a lot of money — eggs have gone down 25 percent in the last couple of weeks.  We inherited that problem: eggs.
Groceries have gone down a little bit.  Energy has gone down.
Do you want to speak to that for a second, Governor?  Would you just say a couple of words, you and Chris, about energy, what’s happened?
SECRETARY BURGUM:  Well, happy to, but I think that — Chris and I just came from CERAWeek, which is the largest conference in the world.  So, global leaders, people from the EU, officials from all the energy-producing countries all there.  And all the global nationals, all the U.S.  The — the spirit of that group is through the roof, because now they realize that in the United States, that President Trump’s policies are pro — pro developing more energy, as opposed to we’re trying to shut down energy.
And that pro-growth, pro-business, pro- — pro-energy approach is giving people the optimism.  So, then the markets are reacting to that, and energy prices on the futures market are going to go down because people know we’re — we’re not going to be killing off the energy we need for prosperity in all of our countries, but also for peace, because people have used energy to fuel these wars that President Trump is working so hard to end.  And — and we — we know that energy — high energy prices were driving the inflation that he talked about.
So, it accomplishes two goals for us — which is prosperity for the world, peace for the world — when we have smart energy policies.  And — and President Trump has brought common sense back to how we think about energy.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  And it’s brought down now $65 a barrel,  I saw this morning.  That’s phenomenal news, and that’s going to bring — that’s what brought it up.  The energy went — they took our beautiful energy policies and they just messed them up.  And then they went immediately back to them, because — but by that time, they lost it.  They lost that bronco, as the expression goes.
Chris, do you have something to say?
SECRETARY WRIGHT:  I think Doug said it well, but you just can’t overstate how important the return of common sense, the return of knowledge about energy and pro-American consumers, pro investment in our country.  I think, globally, that was welcomed.  It means capital flows.  It means more sobriety and lower energy prices, more economic opportunity for Americans.
So, yeah, it was elated atmosphere at a global energy conference.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, we’re working on one project, and it should be very easy.  It’s a pipeline going through a small section of New York.  New York has held it up for years, actually.  For years they’ve wanted to do it. For years and years.  And it will reduce —
The most expensive energy, almost, in the world is in New England, because they have no way of getting it there because it’s been held up by New York.  And the whole of New England and Connecticut and New York — the energy prices are through the roof.  And this one pipeline will save per family, $2,500 just on heating and another $2,500 on everything else.  So, the energy — by just a simple pipeline going through an area that wants it — an area that’s not a rich area; it’s actually a very poor area — would create jobs and everything else.
And it’s going to be way underground.  Nobody’s going to see it.  Once they fill it up, nobody’s going to see it.  Nobody’s going to know it’s there.
And families in New York and Connecticut and New England are going to save $5,000 a family.  Think of that.  Because, right now, they have the highest energy prices maybe in the world, they say.  New England is a disaster.
So, we’re working on that.  In fact, the governor is coming in — governor of New York, Kathy Hochul, who’s a very nice woman.  She’s coming in tomorrow morning at 9 o’clock to meet me on that and other things — not only that, but other things.
So, I hope we don’t have to use the extraordinary powers of the federal government to get it done, but if we have to, we will.  But I don’t think we’ll have to.
I can tell you, Connecticut wants it and all of New England wants it.  And who wouldn’t want it?  And it’s also jobs on top of everything else.  So, that’s going to be very exciting.  So, we’re meeting with the governor tomorrow morning.
(Cross-talk.)
Yeah.
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  Greenland.  What is your vision for the potential annexation of Greenland and getting them, potentially, to —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.
Q    — to statehood?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I think it’ll happen.  And I’m just thinking — I didn’t give it much thought before, but I’m sitting with a man that could be very instrumental.  You know, Mark, we need that for international security — not just security, international.  We have a lot of our favorite players, you know, cruising around the coast, and we have to be careful.  And we’ll be talking to you.
And it’s a very appropriate — really, a very appropriate question.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  It’s an —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  — an issue in the high north, so the Arctic.  So, what you did —
So, when it comes to Greenland, yes or no, joining the U.S., I would leave that outside, for me, this discussion, because I don’t want to drag NATO in that.
But when it comes to the high north in the Arctic, you are totally right.  The Chinese and — are using these routes.  We know that the Russians already arming.  We know we have a lack of icebreakers.  So, the fact that the seven — outside of Russia, there are seven Arctic countries — working together on this, under U.S. leadership — it’s very important to make sure that that region, that that a part of the world stays safe.  And — and we know things are changing there, and we have to be there.
Q    Well, they just had an election there the other day.  I mean, do you see a referendum, a plebiscite where the people of Greenland would be in a position to decide if they want to become part of the United States?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, it was a good election for us, as you know.  It was not a referendum.  It wouldn’t be called that.  It was an individual election.  But the person that did the best is a very good person, as far as we’re concerned.  And so, we’ll be talking about it.  And it’s very important.
Mark mentioned the word “icebreaker.”  So, we’re in the process of ordering 48 icebreakers, and Canada wants to know if they could use them.  I said, “Well, you know, you got to pay for them.”  Think of it.  Canada.  We pay for their military.  You know, Canada pays very little for their military, because they think we’re going to protect them, but — even with the icebreakers.
So, we’re going to order 48, and Canada wants to be part of the deal.  I say, “You got to get your own icebreakers.  I mean, if you’re a state, you can be part of the deal, but if you’re a separate country, you’ve got to get your own icebreakers.”
Russia, as you know, has about 40 of them, and we have 1 big icebreaker.  But that whole area is becoming very important and for a lot of reasons.  The routes are, you know, very direct to Asia, to Russia, and you have ships all over the place.  And we have to have protection.  So, we’re going to have to make a deal on that.
And Denmark is not able to do that.  You know, Denmark is very far away and really has nothing to do.
What happens?  A boat landed there 200 years ago or something, and they say they have rights to it.  I don’t know if that’s true.  I’m not — I don’t think it is, actually.
But we’ve been dealing with Denmark.  We’ve been dealing with Greenland.  And we have to do it.  We really need it for national security.  I think that’s why NATO might have to get involved in a way, because we really need Greenland for national security.  It’s very important.
You know, we have a couple of bases on Greenland already, and we have quite a few soldiers that — maybe you’ll see more and more soldiers go there.  I don’t know.
What do you think about that, Pete? Don’t answer that, Pete.  (Laughter.)  Don’t answer that question.
But we have bases, and we have quite a few soldiers on Greenland already.
Q    Mr. President, some people question your commitment to NATO.  Will everything — anything change?
Your com- — your commitment to NATO, will anything change?  Same amount of money?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I think they made —
Q    Same number of troops?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  — a great step by putting Mark in charge.  I think, to me, that’s a great step, because he and I have seen eye to eye on everything for a long time.  We’ve been doing this a long time now.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Nine years now.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  And so, that’s a great step.
You have to keep NATO strong.  You have to keep it relevant.
But the biggest thing we have to worry about right now is what’s going on right now.  I think the rest is going to take care of itself.
I don’t see this having — this was a fluke.  This was something that if we had a competent president, it would not have happened.  The man was grossly incompetent.  All you have to do is look in — take a look at — he signs by autopen.
Who was signing all this stuff by autopen?  Who would think you signed important documents by autopen?  You know, these are major documents you’re signing.  You’re proud to sign them.  You have your signature on something — in 300 years, they say, “Oh, look.”  Can you imagine?  Everything was signed by autopen — almost everything.  Nobody has ever heard of such a thing.
Q    Do you —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  So —
Q    Sorry.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Should have never happened.
Q    You’re speaking tomorrow at the Justice Department about law and order.  Could you tell us a little bit about that?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, we’re going to be with the Justice Department.  We have a great Justice Department.  Pam Bondi is so fantastic.  And Todd Blanche and Emil — you got to know him a little bit; he was acting for a little while — and some other people are incredible in the Justice Department.
And I consider the FBI to be a part of it, in a sense, and Kash is going to be fantastic, and all the people he’s — Dan Bongino, I love that.  I mean, I love that.  I think Dan is great.
I think we have unbelievable people.  And all I’m going to do is set out my vision.  It’s going to be their vision, really, but it’s my ideas.  And basically, we don’t want to have crime in the streets.  We don’t want to have people pushed into subways and killed, and then the — the person that did the pushing ends up in a 15-year trial and gets off scot-free.  We want to have justice, and we want to have safety in our cities, as well as our communities.
And we’ll be talking about immigration.  We’ll be talking about a lot of things.  Just the complete gamut.  So, I look forward to that.  That will be tomorrow at the Justice Department.
Q    Mr. President, you are a man of peace.  You’ve said it several times and made it very clear.  A man of peace dealing with belligerent people.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.
Q    And I’m thinking we saw you handled Zelenskyy in this very own room.  What is your leverage on Putin?  Are you thinking sanctions?  What if he refuses to —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I do have leverage, but I don’t want to talk about leverage now, because right now we’re talking to him.  And based on the statements he made today, they were pretty positive, I think, so I don’t want to talk about that.
I hope Russia is going to make the deal too.  And I think once that deal happens, you’re never going to be in a process.  I don’t think they’re going back to shooting again.  I really believe if we get a peace treaty, a ceasefire treaty, I think that leads to peace.  That’s going to really lead to a —
I don’t think anyone wants to go back.  They’ve been doing this for a long time, and it’s vicious and violent.  And I think if President Putin agrees and does a ceasefire, I think we’re going to be in very good shape to get it done.  We want to get it over with.  That’s why — it was very important what I instructed everybody, including Steve, what we’re looking for: to discuss concepts of land, concepts of —
MR. WALTZ:  Yes, sir.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  — of power plants because it’s complicated.  You know, you have a whole — you’re sort of creating the edge of a country.
The sad part is that country, if they didn’t — if this didn’t happen — and it wouldn’t have happened — I don’t know if they would have to give anything back.  I guess Crimea?
You know, I said it last time, Crimea was given by Obama, Biden gave them the whole thing, and Bush gave them Georgia.  And Trump didn’t give them anything.
I gave them — you know what I gave them?  I gave them Javelins.  And the Javelins were very effective, as you know.  I gave them nothing —
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  2019.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  And then also, if you take a look, I was the one that stopped the pipeline going into Europe.  It was totally stopped: Nord Stream 2.  Nobody ever heard of Nord Stream 2 before I came along.
But I got along very well with President Putin.  I got along with most of them.  I get along great with President Xi.  I got along great with Kim Jong Un.  I got along great with all of them.  And we had no wars.  We had no problems.  We wiped out ISIS in record time. General “Razin” Kane.  And he wiped them out.
And he is going to be our new chief, right?  He’s going to be —
SECRETARY HEGSETH:  Yes, sir.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  — the head of Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he’s a highly respected man.  He’s going to be great.
Pete is going to be fantastic.  I have no doubt about it.  We have a great team.  A really great team.
Yeah, please.  Go ahead, please.
Q    Mr. President, some of our allies have said that they’re worried that they could be the next to be attacked by Russia.  You’ve spoken directly with the Russian president.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.
Q    Do you think those fears are justified?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, I don’t.  I think when this gets done, it’s done.  They’re going to all want to go home and rest.  I don’t see it happening.  Nope, I don’t see that happening.  And we’ll make sure it doesn’t happen.  Not going to happen.  But we’ll make sure it doesn’t happen.
Yeah, go ahead, please.
Q    Leaders from Russia and Iran are heading to Beijing tomorrow to discuss nuclear programs.  What do you hope to get out of that?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, maybe they’re going to talk about non-nuclear programs.  Maybe they’re going to be talking about the de-escalation of nuclear weapons, because, you know, I was talking about that with President Putin very strongly.  And we could have done something.  Had that election not been rigged, we would have had something.  I think I would have made a deal with Putin on de-escalation, denuclearization, as they say.  But we would have de-escalated nuclear weapons, because the power of nuclear weapons is so great and so devastating.
And, right now, Russia and us have by far the most, but China will catch us within five years.  China doesn’t have — but they’re in the process of building.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: And they build.  And within four or five years, they’ll probably have the same.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  And, by the way, you — this is a Republican tradition.  Ronald Reagan, when he negotiated with Gorbachev —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Right.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  — in the 1980s —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  That’s right.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  — about bringing down the number of nuclear weapons is what you have been doing your first term.  And it is important.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  It would be a great achievement if we could bring down the number.  We have so many weapons, and the power is so great.
And we — number one, you don’t need them to that extent.  And then we’d have to get others, because, as you know, in a smaller way — Kim Jong Un has a lot of nuclear weapons, by the way — a lot — and others do also.  You have India.  You have Pakistan.  You have others that have them, and we’d get them involved.
But we started off with Russia and us.  We have, by far — actually, by far, the most.  And we were going to denuclearize, and that was going to happen.
And then we were going to China.  And I spoke to China.  I spoke to President Xi about it.  And he really liked the idea.  You know, he’d like not to spend trillions of dollars building weapons that, hopefully, he’s never going to have to use.  And — because they are very expensive also.  So, that would have been great.
Okay, one or two more.
(Cross-talk.)
Yeah, go ahead.
Q    Thank you.  We are looking at an impending government shutdown Friday at midnight.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.
Q    Democrats, for 30 years straight, have said, if there’s a shutdown, bad things happen.  Do you anticipate direct negotiations yourself with conference leader of the Democrats, Chuck Schumer?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, if they need me, I’m there a hundred percent.  It’s — right now, it’s two or three people.  If it shuts down, it’s not the Republicans’ fault.  You know, we passed a bill where we had an incredible Republican vote.  We only had one negative vote, a grandstander.  You know, one grandstander.  There’s always a grandstander in the lot.      But it was amazing.  People were amazed that the Republicans were able to vote in unison like that so strongly.      If there’s a shutdown, even the Democrats admit it will be their fault.  And I’m hearing a lot of Democrats are going to vote for it, and I hope they do.  This is an extension.
But ultimately, we want to vote for one big, beautiful bill where we put the taxes in, we put everything in.  We’re going to have big tax cuts.  We’re going to have tremendous incentives for companies coming into our country and employing lots of people.       It’ll be — I called it, in a rare moment, one big, beautiful bill.  That’s what I like.  And it seems to be that’s where they’re heading.  And we’ll have to take care of something to do with Los Angeles.      A place called Los Angeles almost burned to the ground.  By the way, I broke into Los Angeles.  Can you believe it?  I had to break in.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I invaded Los Angeles.  And we opened up the water, and the water is now flowing down.  They have so much water, they don’t know what to do.  They were sending it out to the Pacific for environmental reasons.  Okay?  Can you believe it?  And in the meantime, they lost 25,000 houses.  They lost — and nobody’s ever seen anything like it.      But we have the water.  I’d love to show you a picture.  You’ve seen the picture.  The water is flowing through the half pipes.  You know, we have the big half pipes that go down.  Used to — 25 years ago, they used to have plenty of water, but they turned it off for — again, for environmental reasons.  Well, I turned it on for environmental reasons and also fire reasons.
And I’ve been asking them to do that during my first term.  I said, “Do it.”  I didn’t think anything like — could happen like this, but they didn’t have enough water.      Now the farmers are going to have water for their land, and the water is in there.
But I actually had to break in.  We broke in to do it because we had people that were afraid to give water.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Yeah.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  They were — in particular, they were trying to protect a certain little fish.  And I say, “How do you protect a fish if you don’t have water?”  They didn’t have any water, so they’re protecting a fish, and that didn’t work out too well, by the way.       So, they have a lot of water going down throughout California, all coming out from the Pacific Northwest, even some from Canada.
Thank you, Canada, very much.  I appreciate it.      Next thing you know, they’ll want to turn the water off.  They’ll want to charge us for the water.     But it comes up from the Pacific Northwest, and it’s a beautiful thing to see.  I mean, it is brimming with water.      Now, if they would have had that done, you wouldn’t have had the damage, because the fire would have been put out.  The fire hydrants would have been loaded.  The sprinklers in people’s living rooms and bedrooms would have been loaded up with the — they had no water.  The government makes them put sprinklers in.  They had no water in the sprinklers because they had no water.      So, the water is flowing, and we’re going to have to give a lot of money to Los Angeles to help them, and the Democrats are going to want to do that.  So, that’s the one thing different.      And I frankly, I think that makes it a lot easier.  But one of the big thing is we have the big, beautiful bill.  We got to get that done.  And that will put our country in a position like it’s never been in.      It’s a reduction of taxes.  It’s tremendous incentives for companies to come from all over the world into our country.  It’s great environmentally, but it’s not this environmental scam that we went through — that we all went through.  It provides for everything.
It’s a big, beautiful bill, and I hope we can get it approved.  And that will be next.      But in the meantime, we have the continuing resolution, and the Republicans have approved it, and now the Democrats have to approve it.  And I hope they will.      And I think a lot of them — I can tell you, they want to.  I’ve spoken to some of them.  They really want to.  Their leadership may not want them to.  And if it closes, it’s purely on the Democrats.      All right, one more.     Q    On Korea, sir.  We’ve seen tension increasing in the Peninsula.  You’ve talked about Kim Jong Un.  Do you have any plans of getting — of reestablishing the relationship you had during the first meeting?     PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.  Well, I would.  I had a great relationship with Kim Jong Un, North Korea.  If I wasn’t elected, if Hillary got in, you would have had a nuclear war with North Korea.  He expected it.  He expected it.  And they said, “Oh, thousands of people.”  No, millions of people would have been killed.       But I got in.  We went to Singapore.  We met.  We went to — to Vietnam.  We met.  We got along really good.  We had a very good relationship.  And we still do.  We still do.  You don’t have that threat that you had.
Q    You have talked with — have you talked to him?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I mean, look, when I was running the first time, it looked like there was going to be a war with North Korea.  You know that better than anyone.     SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  Tensions were high.  Yes.  Yeah.     PRESIDENT TRUMP.  Yeah.  And it started off —     SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  And everybody was — was startled that you —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.
SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE:  — invited him for talks.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Right.
NA
NA",19,na na p m edt president trump hello everybody it s great to be with a friend of mine who was prime minister of the netherlands so i got to know him very well we had a great relationship always secretary general rutte absolutely president trump mark rutte now he s secretary general of nato and doing a fantastic job everybody every report i ve gotten is what a great job he did and i m not at all surprised when i hear it we had to support him and we supported him as soon as i heard the name secretary general rutte thank you president trump but he was a fantastic prime minister and he s doing a fantastic job an even tougher job which is tougher being the prime minister of netherlands or secretary general rutte this job is quite tough yeah laughter president trump i would think this is a little tougher secretary general rutte but but dutch politics is also brutal so laughter president trump yeah but this is pretty tough secretary general rutte yeah president trump but you re doing good secretary general rutte thank you president trump we re going to be discussing a lot of things obviously we ll be discussing what s happening with respect to ukraine and russia at this moment we have people talking in russia we have representatives over there steve witkoff and others and they re in very serious discussions as you know ukraine has agreed subject to this what s happening today to a complete ceasefire and we hope russia will do the same thousands of people are being killed young people usually mostly young people we were just talking about it thousands of young people are being killed a week and we want to see that stop and they re not americans and they re not from the netherlands for the most part secretary general rutte no president trump they re not from they re from russia and they re from ukraine but they re people and i think everybody feels the same way we want it to stop it s also a tremendous cost to the united states and to other countries and it s something that would have never happened if i were president and it makes me very angry to see that it did happen but it happened and we have to stop it and mark has done some really good work over the last week we ve been working together and he s done some really good work so i m very happy about that we ll also be talking about trade and various other things and i think we ll have a very very strong day we re going to have lunch afterwards that ll go and then we ll see you all later but mark would you like to say something secretary general rutte yeah first of all thank you so much mr president dear donald again for hosting me and but also for taking time in florida a couple of weeks after you president trump right that s right secretary general rutte you were reelected president trump that s right secretary general rutte and of course our phone call a couple of weeks ago and i must say trump you basically you originated the fact that in europe we are now spending when you take it to aggregate $ billion more on defense president trump yeah secretary general rutte than when you came in office in in but that was trump but when look at trump president trump going to be hard to top laughter secretary general rutte what happened the last couple of weeks is really staggering the europeans committing to a package of $ billion defense spending the germans now president trump yeah secretary general rutte potentially up to half a trillion extra in defense spending and then of course you have keir starmer here the british prime minister and others all committing to much higher defense spending they re not there we need to do more but i really want to work together with you in a run up to the hague summit to make sure that we will have a nato which is really reinvigorated under your leadership and we are getting there we also discussed defense production because we need to produce more weaponry we are not doing enough not in the u s not in europe and we are lagging behind when you compare to the russians and the chinese and you have a huge defense industrial base europeans buying mo four times more here than the other the other way around which is good because you have a strong defense industry but we need to do more there to make sure that we ramp up production and kill the red tape so i would love to work with you on that and finally ukraine you broke the deadlock as you said all the killing the young people dying cities getting destroyed the fact that you did that that you started the dialogue with the russians and the successful talks in saudi arabia now with the ukrainians i really want to commend you for this so well the hague is my hometown i d love to host you there in the summer and work together to make sure that president trump we ll do that secretary general rutte that will be a splash a real success projecting american power on the world stage president trump what mark is saying is when i first went to nato my first meeting i noticed that very few people were paying and if they were they weren t paying their fair share there were only seven countries that were paying what they were supposed to be paying which was secretary general rutte it s even worse there were three president trump yeah secretary general rutte that s even worse president trump it could be even worse secretary general rutte yeah president trump but there were just very few countries that were paying and even the paying it was at percent which is too low it should be higher it should be quite a bit higher but you had poland and i remember poland was actually paying a little bit more than they were supposed to which i was very impressed with and they ve been actually terrific and some of the others but most of them weren t paying or they were paying very little and i didn t think it was appropriate to bring it up there but i said it s going to be brought up at my next meeting and my next meeting you know the first meeting you want to give them a little break the second meeting it began and i was able to raise secretary general rutte you did laughs president trump hundreds of billions of dollars i just said we re not going to be involved with you if you re not going to pay and the money started pouring in and nato became much stronger because of my actions and working along with a lot of people including mark but they would not pay for other presidents i don t think other presidents even knew that they weren t paid i asked first question has everybody paid up and literally i mean they showed they told me seven you could be right it could be three but that makes it even worse but they just weren t paying and i said no i won t protect if you re not paying if you re delinquent or if the money isn t paid why would we do that and as soon as i said that got a little hit from the press because they said oh gee that s not very nice but if you said the other nobody would have paid and the money started coming in by the billions and you know hundreds of billions of dollars flowed into nato and nato became strong secretary general rutte yeah president trump and you remember that and your predecessor who i thought was a very good man actually secretary general rutte absolutely jens stoltenberg he sends his best greetings president trump yeah he was terrific secretary general rutte yeah president trump stoltenberg secretary general secretary general rutte great man president trump and he made the statement that when trump came in the money started coming in like we never saw before hundreds of billions it was actually probably close to $ billion came in and nato became strong from that standpoint and now we have to use it wisely and we have to get this war over with and you ll be back to a normal much more normal life and maybe we re close we re getting words that things are going okay in russia and it doesn t mean anything until we hear what the final outcome is but they have very serious discussions going on right now with president putin and others and hopefully they all want to end this nightmare it s a nightmare it s a horrible thing when you look i get pictures every week they give me the pictures of the battlefield which i almost don t want to see it s so horrible to see secretary general rutte it s so terrible president trump young people laying arms and legs and heads laying all over the field it s the most terrible thing that you ll ever see and it s got to stop these are young people with mothers and fathers and sisters and brothers and friends and it s got to stop so we hopefully are going to be in a good position sometime today to have a good idea we ll have we know where we are with ukraine and we are getting good signals outside of russia as to where we are with russia and hopefully they ll do the right thing it s a really humanity we re talking about humanity we re not talking about the money but then you add the money to it and you know hundreds of billions of dollars is being spent and really wasted so unnecessarily it should have never happened so it s an honor to have you here they picked a great gentleman i ll tell you that was i was so happy to hear because you had somebody stoltenberg was really good and you have somebody that s going to do an incredible job and i was so much in favor of you you have no idea they had another person that i did not like laughter i was not happy and i think i kept him from you know what i m talking about i said this is the right man to do it and he really did he was a great prime minister of the netherlands he did a great job and that s what he s doing right now so thank you everybody for being here and very great honor to have you and we even have some of our great energy people here today right we have the governor and we have chris you know chris secretary general rutte yeah absolutely president trump he s supposed to be the most talented man in the world of energy according to the governor laughter so i don t know if he s right and we have general you ve been fantastic thank you very much and we have a lot of good people that won t be so much involved with this but they wanted to see what was happening it s become a little bit of a show laughter but they wanted to see what was happening and i think a lot of good things are happening so with that if anybody would have a question cross talk q mr president o on russia president trump please go ahead q vlad q sorry sorry mary steve witkoff s trip to moscow you spoke about it what sort of agreement do you hope he comes away from there with president trump well we d like to see a ceasefire from russia and we have you know not been working in the dark we ve been discussing with ukraine land and pieces of land that would be kept and lost and all of the other elements of a final agreement there s a power plant involved you know a very big power plant involved who s going to get the power plant and who s going to get this and that and so you know it s not an easy process but phase one is the ceasefire a lot of the individual subjects have been discussed though you know we ve been discussing concepts of land because you don t want to waste time with the ceasefire if it s not going to mean anything so we re saying look this is what you can get this is what you can t get they discussed nato and being in nato and everybody knows what the answer to that is they ve known that answer for years in all fairness so a lot of the details of a final agreement have actually been discussed now we re going to see whether or not russia is there and if they re not it ll be a very disappointing moment for the world yeah q and vladimir putin just said he is open to a ceasefire but he does still have some concerns he suggested that you two should speak directly do you have plans to speak to him soon if so when president trump well i would yeah sure q and are you confident you can get this across the finish line president trump sure he did say that today it was a very promising statement because other people are saying different things and you don t know if they have anything to really if they have any meaning or i don t know i think some of them were making statements i don t think they have anything to do with it no he put out a very promising statement but it wasn t complete and yeah i d love to meet with him or talk to him but we have to get it over with fast you know every day people are being killed it s not like as we sit here two people will be killed think of it two people are going to be killed during this little period of time thousands of people a week are dying so we really don t have very much time we have to make this fast it shouldn t be very complicated cross talk yes q thank you mr president a representative of canada the finance minister are in town and will meet members of your administration during the day president trump sure yeah q any chances that you will ban on the tariffs on aluminum and and the the ones that are planned for april nd president trump no q you are not going to change your mind president trump no i m not look we ve been ripped off for years and we re not going to be ripped off anymore no i m not going to bend at all on aluminum or steel or cars we re not going to bend we ve been ripped off as a country for many many years we ve been subjected to costs that we shouldn t be subjected to in the case of canada we re spending $ billion a year to subsidize canada i love canada i love the people of canada i have many friends in canada the great one wayne gretzky the great hey how good is wayne gretzky he s the great one but we have i know many people from canada that are good friends of mine but you know the united states can t subsidize a country for $ billion a year we don t need their cars we don t need their energy we don t need their lumber we don t need anything that they give we do it because we want to be helpful but it comes a point when you just can t do that you have to run your own country and to be honest with you canada only works as a state we don t need anything they have as a state it would be one of the great states anywhere this would be the most incredible country visually if you look at a map they drew an artificial line right through it between canada and the u s just a straight artificial line somebody did it a long time ago many many decades ago and makes no sense it s so perfect as a great and cherished state keeping o canada the national anthem i love it i think it s great keep it but it ll be for the state one of our greatest states maybe our greatest state but why should we subsidize another country for $ billion it costs us $ billion a year and again we don t need their lumber we don t need their energy we have more than they do we don t need anything we don t need their cars i d much rather make the cars here and there s not a thing that we need now there ll be a little disruption but it won t be very long but they need us we really don t need them and we have to do this i m sorry we have to do this yes q mr president president trump yeah q you have made it very clear that nato needs to step up although great progress president trump yeah q has been made in your first mandate how do you envision this new transatlantic president trump are you talking about nato stepping up q yes president trump well nato is stepping up through this man this man is a man that only knows how to step up and we have the same goal in mind we want the war ended and he s doing his job he only knows how to do a good job that s one thing that s why i fought for him to get that job secretary general rutte thank you so much president trump because they had some other candidates that i ll tell you would not have done a very good job secretary general rutte i need this part of the of the movie for my family laughter president trump that s right that s right we ll get you a clip secretary general rutte yeah exactly laughs president trump we re going to get him a clip of that of that little last essay but the rest of the statements he doesn t care about q sir how does this new transatlantic cooperation how do you envision it what is it going to look like president trump well we have that s one thing i mean you know we re the other side of the ocean and they re right there and yet we re in for $ billion because of biden and they re in for $ billion so it s a big difference and it s unfair and i said you have to equalize they should equalize they should have it should have never happened where biden just gave his money away now as you know we have an agreement with ukraine on the rare earths and other things and that ll get us something back a lot back it ll get us our money back we re not doing it for that though we re doing i m just doing this to get the war stopped i m doing it really to save lives but at the same time we were treated very unfairly as we always are by every country and we re in for very substantially more than the european nations are in for and that shouldn t be you know they re much more affected by it than we are because we do have an ocean in between but i don t know i think good things are going to happen i really do i think good things are going to happen i do say we were talking before and mark was very nice he said if you wouldn t get involved there would be you d just be going on secretary general rutte yeah president trump this thing would have gone on for a long time secretary general rutte breaking a deadlock it was crucial president trump yeah we broke a deadlock secretary general rutte yeah president trump we did break a deadlock i hope it s meaningful secretary general rutte yeah president trump yes did you have one q mr president president trump yeah please q yes sir thank you mr president amanda head with just the news on the southern border you ve got dhs and ice who are reporting that there was a little bit of fudging of numbers during the biden administration president trump yeah q on both the catch and the release side with respect to reporting the number of illegals coming into the country who were released president trump they cheated on the numbers they were the numbers were i love that question q right president trump who are you with q just the news amanda head president trump very nice that s good that s good q do you know how many of those are criminal illegal aliens president trump many of them q and biden is out of office president trump yeah q alejandro mayorkas who gets held accountable president trump no biden fudged the numbers the numbers were totally fake and he gave fake numbers i knew they were fake everybody knew they were fake but now it came out and terrible what what they did that administration was a horror show for this country q can you hold anyone accountable president trump well i don t know they gave phony numbers and phony numbers are a very bad thing to give but i m not sure about that i don t know how it would play we want to get it straightened out we have we re after many many bad people that were let into our country and kristi noem and my friend homan how good is tom homan doing right and they re after them and they i mean you see they re taking them out in record numbers gang members gang leaders drug dealers this is a problem the netherlands does not have the netherlands never had this problem if you d like to take secretary general rutte we have a few drug drug dealers i m afraid laughter president trump i could deliver some people i could deliver some nice people to the netherlands if you d like laughter secretary general rutte i m not sure laughs president trump no what he did to this country letting million people flow through an open border many of those people were hard criminals from prisons and jails from mental institutions and i always say insane asylums because they were seriously deranged and they re here from not south america from all over the world from south america but from all over the world and it s so sad you d say why would anybody do this why yeah go ahead q and and one more there s some new internal democrat polling that doesn t look great for democrats but it also has percent unfavorability for republicans in swing states and battlegrounds for the midterms do you consider those voters cap capturable for for republicans president trump yeah well we did you know i won every swing state as you know by a lot and i won the popular vote by a lot and we won the counties if you look at the counties and district plan we had and they had that s a real that s why the map is all red so we had a great thing yeah i think winning from the democrats i saw if you looked the other night i made a speech and i introduced two young ladies who were killed two killed viciously violently killed young unbelievable both outstanding people they were killed by illegal aliens and the democrats wouldn t get up and applaud the mothers were i mean inconsolable they were crying and everybody was crying the democrats sat there with stone faces they didn t clap they didn t stand they didn t do anything we had a young man with very serious cancer wanted to his dream is to be with the police department someday and he was introduced secretary general rutte that was very touching president trump they didn t even clap secretary general rutte yeah i saw it president trump i mean they were disgusting frankly they were disgusting there s something wrong with them they re deranged they re deranged like jack smith they re deranged people and i never saw anything like it i m standing up and i introduce the mother and the parents of these two young girls that were just recently essentially killed violently killed and the democrats are like this it s so sad and i saw this morning where one of them is pretty well known one is arguing fighting like crazy over men being able to play in women s sports i said yeah i thought that was tried i thought that was about a i think it s a percent issue but in a way i want them to keep doing it because i don t think they can win a race i mean and i tell the republicans i said don t bring that subject up because there s no election right now but about a week before the election bring it up because you can t lose and everything is transgender this transgender that you know they have bad politics but one thing they stick together you know i wish and the republicans stick together mostly but we have a couple that are grandstanders you know you always have grandstanders in life but the democrats they don t seem they have grandstanders but when it comes to a vote they do stick together right vice president vance they get in line yes sir president trump so q it seems like they ll stick together on the shutdown will that hurt democrats going into midterms president trump well if they do a shutdown and ultimately that might lead to very very high taxes because we re talking about a shutdown we re talking about getting to work immediately on the greatest tax bill ever passed that was the one we did it s a renewal and it s an addition to it and we re going to cut people s taxes and if we don t open the democrats are stopping all of these good things that we re providing we re providing the greatest package of benefits that this country has ever provided the biggest part of that s going to be tax cuts for the middle class and for businesses small businesses employers people that hire people and jobs and if it s shut down it s only going to be if there s a shutdown it s only because of the democrats and they would really be taking away a lot from our country and from the people of our country q mr president on on tariffs you made clear you re not backing down from this but many american small business owners say they are concerned that these tariffs are going to hurt them what s your message to them president trump they re going to be so much richer than they are right now and we have many yesterday general motors was in they want to invest $ billion the people from facebook were in yesterday they re going to invest $ billion by the end of the year other people are talking about numbers apple as you know a few days ago announced $ billion investment they re going to build their plants in the united states which as you know almost all of their plants are in china now they re building in the united states look the reason is two things number one the election november th and the other thing is tariffs i think probably in that order but tim cook came in and he announced think of it $ billion not million five hundred million is a lot when you think about it right but vice president vance yes sir president trump i would have been happy with $ million but it s $ billion investment by apple in the united states and that s because of the election result and it s because of the tariffs and the tax incentives too you know tariffs and tax incentives and i ve never seen anything like it we have plants going up now in indiana we have plants going up in michigan a lot of plants going to be planned from i m trying to steer them to michigan because michigan got so badly beaten by you know what happened with europe you know if you look at europe take a look at the eu we re not allowed to sell cars there it s prohibitive because of their policies and also their nonmonetary tariffs they put obstacles in your way that you can do nothing about but if you take a look at what happens so we sell no cars to europe i mean virtually no cars and they sell millions of cars to us they don t take our agriculture we take their agriculture it s like a one way street with them the european union is very very nasty they sue our companies apple was forced to pay $ billion on a case that very much like my cases that i won they shouldn t have been even cases but we felt they had no case and they ended up having an extremely favorable judge and decision but they re suing google they re suing facebook they re suing all of these companies and they re taking billions of dollars out of american companies many more than the ones i just mentioned and i guess they re using it to run europe or something i don t know what they re using it for but they treat us very badly china obviously treats this very badly almost everybody does and i blame past presidents to be honest because when i was president i we received so far about $ billion from china over the years on the tariffs that i put in no other president got cents from china and that was only beginning except for covid it would have i would have been able to finish the process but we had to fight the covid thing and we did really well with it but we had to fight and then we had actually as you remember mark we actually handed over the stock market it was higher than just previous to covid coming in which was sort of a miracle frankly we did a good job but the tariffs are very important and i think the psychology there s great spirit when mark came in he said congratulations there s a whole new spirit there s a whole new light over this country and really over the world secretary general rutte yeah president trump because you have somebody that a whole group of people really because i talk about this whole group that we know what we re doing and a lot of great things are happening but i ve never seen investment like this trillions of dollars is being invested in the united states now that would have never our country could have failed another four years of this what happened in the last four years our country would have been a crime ridden mess and i don t know if you noticed a little thing they call it but it s not a little thing if you don t have if you like eggs and you don t have a lot of money eggs have gone down percent in the last couple of weeks we inherited that problem eggs groceries have gone down a little bit energy has gone down do you want to speak to that for a second governor would you just say a couple of words you and chris about energy what s happened secretary burgum well happy to but i think that chris and i just came from ceraweek which is the largest conference in the world so global leaders people from the eu officials from all the energy producing countries all there and all the global nationals all the u s the the spirit of that group is through the roof because now they realize that in the united states that president trump s policies are pro pro developing more energy as opposed to we re trying to shut down energy and that pro growth pro business pro pro energy approach is giving people the optimism so then the markets are reacting to that and energy prices on the futures market are going to go down because people know we re we re not going to be killing off the energy we need for prosperity in all of our countries but also for peace because people have used energy to fuel these wars that president trump is working so hard to end and and we we know that energy high energy prices were driving the inflation that he talked about so it accomplishes two goals for us which is prosperity for the world peace for the world when we have smart energy policies and and president trump has brought common sense back to how we think about energy president trump and it s brought down now $ a barrel i saw this morning that s phenomenal news and that s going to bring that s what brought it up the energy went they took our beautiful energy policies and they just messed them up and then they went immediately back to them because but by that time they lost it they lost that bronco as the expression goes chris do you have something to say secretary wright i think doug said it well but you just can t overstate how important the return of common sense the return of knowledge about energy and pro american consumers pro investment in our country i think globally that was welcomed it means capital flows it means more sobriety and lower energy prices more economic opportunity for americans so yeah it was elated atmosphere at a global energy conference president trump well we re working on one project and it should be very easy it s a pipeline going through a small section of new york new york has held it up for years actually for years they ve wanted to do it for years and years and it will reduce the most expensive energy almost in the world is in new england because they have no way of getting it there because it s been held up by new york and the whole of new england and connecticut and new york the energy prices are through the roof and this one pipeline will save per family $ just on heating and another $ on everything else so the energy by just a simple pipeline going through an area that wants it an area that s not a rich area it s actually a very poor area would create jobs and everything else and it s going to be way underground nobody s going to see it once they fill it up nobody s going to see it nobody s going to know it s there and families in new york and connecticut and new england are going to save $ a family think of that because right now they have the highest energy prices maybe in the world they say new england is a disaster so we re working on that in fact the governor is coming in governor of new york kathy hochul who s a very nice woman she s coming in tomorrow morning at o clock to meet me on that and other things not only that but other things so i hope we don t have to use the extraordinary powers of the federal government to get it done but if we have to we will but i don t think we ll have to i can tell you connecticut wants it and all of new england wants it and who wouldn t want it and it s also jobs on top of everything else so that s going to be very exciting so we re meeting with the governor tomorrow morning cross talk yeah q thank you mr president greenland what is your vision for the potential annexation of greenland and getting them potentially to president trump yeah q to statehood president trump well i think it ll happen and i m just thinking i didn t give it much thought before but i m sitting with a man that could be very instrumental you know mark we need that for international security not just security international we have a lot of our favorite players you know cruising around the coast and we have to be careful and we ll be talking to you and it s a very appropriate really a very appropriate question secretary general rutte it s an president trump thank you very much secretary general rutte an issue in the high north so the arctic so what you did so when it comes to greenland yes or no joining the u s i would leave that outside for me this discussion because i don t want to drag nato in that but when it comes to the high north in the arctic you are totally right the chinese and are using these routes we know that the russians already arming we know we have a lack of icebreakers so the fact that the seven outside of russia there are seven arctic countries working together on this under u s leadership it s very important to make sure that that region that that a part of the world stays safe and and we know things are changing there and we have to be there q well they just had an election there the other day i mean do you see a referendum a plebiscite where the people of greenland would be in a position to decide if they want to become part of the united states president trump yeah it was a good election for us as you know it was not a referendum it wouldn t be called that it was an individual election but the person that did the best is a very good person as far as we re concerned and so we ll be talking about it and it s very important mark mentioned the word icebreaker so we re in the process of ordering icebreakers and canada wants to know if they could use them i said well you know you got to pay for them think of it canada we pay for their military you know canada pays very little for their military because they think we re going to protect them but even with the icebreakers so we re going to order and canada wants to be part of the deal i say you got to get your own icebreakers i mean if you re a state you can be part of the deal but if you re a separate country you ve got to get your own icebreakers russia as you know has about of them and we have big icebreaker but that whole area is becoming very important and for a lot of reasons the routes are you know very direct to asia to russia and you have ships all over the place and we have to have protection so we re going to have to make a deal on that and denmark is not able to do that you know denmark is very far away and really has nothing to do what happens a boat landed there years ago or something and they say they have rights to it i don t know if that s true i m not i don t think it is actually but we ve been dealing with denmark we ve been dealing with greenland and we have to do it we really need it for national security i think that s why nato might have to get involved in a way because we really need greenland for national security it s very important you know we have a couple of bases on greenland already and we have quite a few soldiers that maybe you ll see more and more soldiers go there i don t know what do you think about that pete don t answer that pete laughter don t answer that question but we have bases and we have quite a few soldiers on greenland already q mr president some people question your commitment to nato will everything anything change your com your commitment to nato will anything change same amount of money president trump well i think they made q same number of troops president trump a great step by putting mark in charge i think to me that s a great step because he and i have seen eye to eye on everything for a long time we ve been doing this a long time now secretary general rutte nine years now president trump and so that s a great step you have to keep nato strong you have to keep it relevant but the biggest thing we have to worry about right now is what s going on right now i think the rest is going to take care of itself i don t see this having this was a fluke this was something that if we had a competent president it would not have happened the man was grossly incompetent all you have to do is look in take a look at he signs by autopen who was signing all this stuff by autopen who would think you signed important documents by autopen you know these are major documents you re signing you re proud to sign them you have your signature on something in years they say oh look can you imagine everything was signed by autopen almost everything nobody has ever heard of such a thing q do you president trump so q sorry president trump should have never happened q you re speaking tomorrow at the justice department about law and order could you tell us a little bit about that president trump yeah we re going to be with the justice department we have a great justice department pam bondi is so fantastic and todd blanche and emil you got to know him a little bit he was acting for a little while and some other people are incredible in the justice department and i consider the fbi to be a part of it in a sense and kash is going to be fantastic and all the people he s dan bongino i love that i mean i love that i think dan is great i think we have unbelievable people and all i m going to do is set out my vision it s going to be their vision really but it s my ideas and basically we don t want to have crime in the streets we don t want to have people pushed into subways and killed and then the the person that did the pushing ends up in a year trial and gets off scot free we want to have justice and we want to have safety in our cities as well as our communities and we ll be talking about immigration we ll be talking about a lot of things just the complete gamut so i look forward to that that will be tomorrow at the justice department q mr president you are a man of peace you ve said it several times and made it very clear a man of peace dealing with belligerent people president trump yeah q and i m thinking we saw you handled zelenskyy in this very own room what is your leverage on putin are you thinking sanctions what if he refuses to president trump well i do have leverage but i don t want to talk about leverage now because right now we re talking to him and based on the statements he made today they were pretty positive i think so i don t want to talk about that i hope russia is going to make the deal too and i think once that deal happens you re never going to be in a process i don t think they re going back to shooting again i really believe if we get a peace treaty a ceasefire treaty i think that leads to peace that s going to really lead to a i don t think anyone wants to go back they ve been doing this for a long time and it s vicious and violent and i think if president putin agrees and does a ceasefire i think we re going to be in very good shape to get it done we want to get it over with that s why it was very important what i instructed everybody including steve what we re looking for to discuss concepts of land concepts of mr waltz yes sir president trump of power plants because it s complicated you know you have a whole you re sort of creating the edge of a country the sad part is that country if they didn t if this didn t happen and it wouldn t have happened i don t know if they would have to give anything back i guess crimea you know i said it last time crimea was given by obama biden gave them the whole thing and bush gave them georgia and trump didn t give them anything i gave them you know what i gave them i gave them javelins and the javelins were very effective as you know i gave them nothing secretary general rutte president trump and then also if you take a look i was the one that stopped the pipeline going into europe it was totally stopped nord stream nobody ever heard of nord stream before i came along but i got along very well with president putin i got along with most of them i get along great with president xi i got along great with kim jong un i got along great with all of them and we had no wars we had no problems we wiped out isis in record time general razin kane and he wiped them out and he is going to be our new chief right he s going to be secretary hegseth yes sir president trump the head of joint chiefs of staff and he s a highly respected man he s going to be great pete is going to be fantastic i have no doubt about it we have a great team a really great team yeah please go ahead please q mr president some of our allies have said that they re worried that they could be the next to be attacked by russia you ve spoken directly with the russian president president trump yeah q do you think those fears are justified president trump no i don t i think when this gets done it s done they re going to all want to go home and rest i don t see it happening nope i don t see that happening and we ll make sure it doesn t happen not going to happen but we ll make sure it doesn t happen yeah go ahead please q leaders from russia and iran are heading to beijing tomorrow to discuss nuclear programs what do you hope to get out of that president trump well maybe they re going to talk about non nuclear programs maybe they re going to be talking about the de escalation of nuclear weapons because you know i was talking about that with president putin very strongly and we could have done something had that election not been rigged we would have had something i think i would have made a deal with putin on de escalation denuclearization as they say but we would have de escalated nuclear weapons because the power of nuclear weapons is so great and so devastating and right now russia and us have by far the most but china will catch us within five years china doesn t have but they re in the process of building secretary general rutte yeah president trump and they build and within four or five years they ll probably have the same secretary general rutte and by the way you this is a republican tradition ronald reagan when he negotiated with gorbachev president trump right secretary general rutte in the s president trump that s right secretary general rutte about bringing down the number of nuclear weapons is what you have been doing your first term and it is important president trump it would be a great achievement if we could bring down the number we have so many weapons and the power is so great and we number one you don t need them to that extent and then we d have to get others because as you know in a smaller way kim jong un has a lot of nuclear weapons by the way a lot and others do also you have india you have pakistan you have others that have them and we d get them involved but we started off with russia and us we have by far actually by far the most and we were going to denuclearize and that was going to happen and then we were going to china and i spoke to china i spoke to president xi about it and he really liked the idea you know he d like not to spend trillions of dollars building weapons that hopefully he s never going to have to use and because they are very expensive also so that would have been great okay one or two more cross talk yeah go ahead q thank you we are looking at an impending government shutdown friday at midnight president trump yeah q democrats for years straight have said if there s a shutdown bad things happen do you anticipate direct negotiations yourself with conference leader of the democrats chuck schumer president trump yeah if they need me i m there a hundred percent it s right now it s two or three people if it shuts down it s not the republicans fault you know we passed a bill where we had an incredible republican vote we only had one negative vote a grandstander you know one grandstander there s always a grandstander in the lot but it was amazing people were amazed that the republicans were able to vote in unison like that so strongly if there s a shutdown even the democrats admit it will be their fault and i m hearing a lot of democrats are going to vote for it and i hope they do this is an extension but ultimately we want to vote for one big beautiful bill where we put the taxes in we put everything in we re going to have big tax cuts we re going to have tremendous incentives for companies coming into our country and employing lots of people it ll be i called it in a rare moment one big beautiful bill that s what i like and it seems to be that s where they re heading and we ll have to take care of something to do with los angeles a place called los angeles almost burned to the ground by the way i broke into los angeles can you believe it i had to break in secretary general rutte yeah president trump i invaded los angeles and we opened up the water and the water is now flowing down they have so much water they don t know what to do they were sending it out to the pacific for environmental reasons okay can you believe it and in the meantime they lost houses they lost and nobody s ever seen anything like it but we have the water i d love to show you a picture you ve seen the picture the water is flowing through the half pipes you know we have the big half pipes that go down used to years ago they used to have plenty of water but they turned it off for again for environmental reasons well i turned it on for environmental reasons and also fire reasons and i ve been asking them to do that during my first term i said do it i didn t think anything like could happen like this but they didn t have enough water now the farmers are going to have water for their land and the water is in there but i actually had to break in we broke in to do it because we had people that were afraid to give water secretary general rutte yeah president trump they were in particular they were trying to protect a certain little fish and i say how do you protect a fish if you don t have water they didn t have any water so they re protecting a fish and that didn t work out too well by the way so they have a lot of water going down throughout california all coming out from the pacific northwest even some from canada thank you canada very much i appreciate it next thing you know they ll want to turn the water off they ll want to charge us for the water but it comes up from the pacific northwest and it s a beautiful thing to see i mean it is brimming with water now if they would have had that done you wouldn t have had the damage because the fire would have been put out the fire hydrants would have been loaded the sprinklers in people s living rooms and bedrooms would have been loaded up with the they had no water the government makes them put sprinklers in they had no water in the sprinklers because they had no water so the water is flowing and we re going to have to give a lot of money to los angeles to help them and the democrats are going to want to do that so that s the one thing different and i frankly i think that makes it a lot easier but one of the big thing is we have the big beautiful bill we got to get that done and that will put our country in a position like it s never been in it s a reduction of taxes it s tremendous incentives for companies to come from all over the world into our country it s great environmentally but it s not this environmental scam that we went through that we all went through it provides for everything it s a big beautiful bill and i hope we can get it approved and that will be next but in the meantime we have the continuing resolution and the republicans have approved it and now the democrats have to approve it and i hope they will and i think a lot of them i can tell you they want to i ve spoken to some of them they really want to their leadership may not want them to and if it closes it s purely on the democrats all right one more q on korea sir we ve seen tension increasing in the peninsula you ve talked about kim jong un do you have any plans of getting of reestablishing the relationship you had during the first meeting president trump yeah well i would i had a great relationship with kim jong un north korea if i wasn t elected if hillary got in you would have had a nuclear war with north korea he expected it he expected it and they said oh thousands of people no millions of people would have been killed but i got in we went to singapore we met we went to to vietnam we met we got along really good we had a very good relationship and we still do we still do you don t have that threat that you had q you have talked with have you talked to him president trump i mean look when i was running the first time it looked like there was going to be a war with north korea you know that better than anyone secretary general rutte tensions were high yes yeah president trump yeah and it started off secretary general rutte and everybody was was startled that you president trump yeah secretary general rutte invited him for talks president trump right na na

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  What a great group this is.  You have to see outside.  It’s going wild outside with a lot of love for all of us, I guess.  (Laughter.)
But thank you, Richard, for the introduction.  And thank you to all for such a warm welcome.
It’s great to be back in beautiful Miami, where I’ve actually built a lot of great buildings with the Dezer family and some others.  We’ve had tremendous success in Miami.  We have Trump Towers in Sunny Isles Beach.  It’s four beautiful buildings right on the ocean.
The Trump Grande — put the little E on the end for a little — class it up a little bit.  (Laughter.)  Trump Grande.
And the 700-acre Doral.  That’s a tremendous country club in the — it’s actually the most successful country club in the U.S., where I was just given approval to build 1,500 units.
And I couldn’t care less about building units.  When you’re president, who the hell wants to build units?  (Laughter.)  I’ve been building units all my life.  I don’t want to build units, but they gave us permission to do it.
But today is a tremendous honor to become the first American president to address the Future Investment Initiative Institute.  That’s the first one.  That’s very — it’s always nice.  (Applause.)
And I want to thank Mayor of Miami Francis Suarez for being here.  Thank you very much, Francis, wherever you may be.  (Applause.)  Hi, Francis.  And thank you for the endorsement when I ran.  I was very appreciative.
Along with the mayor of Miami Beach, Steven Meiner.  Steven, thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you, Steven.  Thank you very much.
And numerous American business leaders, some of the bi- — biggest business leaders, actually, anywhere in the world, and many distinguished guests from the Middle East, and, in particular, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia — a special place with special leaders.  (Applause.)
And including FII Institute chairman and governor of the Public Investment Fund, which is a seriously big fund, Yasir.  I see you there.  Stand up, Yasir.  (Applause.)  Everyone knows Yasir.  Thank you.  Great guy.  Great, great person.
And Finance Minister Mohammed, thank you very much.  Thank you right — thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Good to see you again.  That’s pretty good: finance minister of that part of the world.  That’s not bad.  (Laughter.)  Other parts of the world, not so good, but that one is good.  (Laughter.)
And many other senior government leaders.  I also want to recognize the Kingdom’s ambassador to the United States, Her Royal Highness Princess Reema.  (Applause.)  Ooh, very popular.  Very popular.  Wow.  That’s very nice.  Sitting next to Elon.  Wow, that’s — you couldn’t do better than that, huh?  (Applause.)
As well as my own special envoy to the Middle East, who has really done a fantastic job, Steve Witkoff.  Thank you, Steve.  (Applause.)  He’s been busy.  And Michael Waltz is here.  Where is Michael?  Michael has been so busy.  They’ve been going back and forth and back.
And a woman who was just voted the most powerful woman an- — anywhere in the world — (applause) — no, I’ll go with — I’m going to go with Princess Reema — but she was voted the most powerful woman anywhere in the world: Susie Wiles.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Most powerful woman, that’s pretty good.  We have to talk to you about that, Susie.  That’s pretty good.  (Laughter.)
And also, we all know Jared Kushner, a very special guy.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Jared.  Thank you, Jared.
And Elon Musk.  He’s been making a little news lately, hasn’t he, though?  (Applause.)  Very positive news.  Stand up, Elon.  (Applause.)  He’s a great guy.
We did a little show last night.  I heard that it got very good ratings, too, by the way.  We did “Hannity.”  Sean Hannity was fantastic — a fantastic man, a fantastic guy, and he did a show.  And it was great being on the show with you last night.
I come today with a simple message for business leaders from all across the nation and all around the world: If you want to build the future, push boundaries, unleash breakthroughs, transform industries, and make a fortune — because you want to make fortune; most of you have already made a fortune, I don’t want to say — (laughter) — there is no better place on Earth than the current and future United States of America under a certain president named Donald J. Trump.  I think that you’re going to do very well.  (Applause.)
They’re saying that November 5th — Election Day — 2024, will go down as one of the most important days in the history of our country.  They said, “In 129 years, the most consequential election.”  I don’t know if they’re right about that or not, but it sounds good.  I wanted to see if I could get a couple of more years tacked on, but I figured the fight wasn’t really worth it.  One hundred and twenty-nine is a lot.
And as of January 20th, 2025, the dark days of high taxes, crushing regulations, rampant inflation, flagrant corruption, government weaponization — ooh, I know about weaponization — and total incompetence will be gone forever.  Will be gone forever.  (Applause.)  Because the United States is back and open for business, and the golden age of America has officially begun.  You see it happening.  (Applause.)
Since my election, America’s economic engines have come roaring back to life in just a very short period of time.  Think of it.  From November 5th, the — the progress that’s been made has been amazing.  The Nasdaq is up nearly 10 percent in just a few months, and that’s a lot.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 2,200 points.
And Bitcoin has set multiple all-time record highs, because everyone knows that I’m committed to making America the crypto capital.  We want to stay — we want to stay at the forefront of everything, and one of them is crypto.  And Miami seems to be the center of the action, come to think of it, and maybe it’ll stay there.
Business optimism skyrocketed 42 points — think of that — in a single month.  The most in history, by far.  That’s the biggest increase in history by not even close.
The ISM index of manufacturing activity surged into positive territory for the first time in many years.  Amazing.
And it was just announced — this is an interesting one.  I didn’t realize it was that bad for so long.  But it was just announced by one of the nation’s most historically accurate and respected pollsters, Rasmussen, that the number of Americans who believe our country is on the right track now exceeds those who think it’s heading in the wrong direction for the first time in 20 years.  Can you believe you that?  Twenty years.  (Applause.)  And this is really a seismic 27-point swing from just before the election.  That’s — nobody has ever seen anything like that one, Yasir.  I want to tell you.  That’s a big one.  (Laughter.)
The best and most successful business leaders on Earth are now racing to invest in the United States.  Since November, DAMAC has announced plans to invest $40 billion in the U.S., creating at least 10,000 jobs.  SoftBank has announced investments of between $100- and $200 billion, creating at least 100,000 American jobs.  Oracle and OpenAI and SoftBank are now collectively committing $500 billion to keep the United States on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence.
And so many more — I mean, so many companies, they want to come to the White House and have a little news conference all the time.  I said, “Why don’t you just announce it?”  But they want to come, and I’ll do that.  I don’t mind doing that.  I say anytime they want to go $10 billion or more, I’m — I’m there.  (Laughter and applause.)  Ten billion or more.
But on his recent visit to the White House, the prime minister of Japan announced he anticipates Japanese investment in the United States of well over a trillion dollars, and we’re working on an Alaska pipeline already, which is the closest point to Asia.
And as you know, the ANWR, which we’ve started, Ronald Reagan couldn’t get it approved.  Nobody could get it approved for so many years.  Couldn’t get it approved.  I got it approved.  Actually, I got it approved twice.  I got it approved, and Biden ended it.  That was a shocker.  But we just got it approved again.  And we’re going to be — (applause) — it’s — it’s probably the largest deposit maybe anywhere in the world, just by itself.  It’s — they say of similar size to Saudi Arabia, so we hope that’s correct.
But all of this is only happening because of the world-changing results of the 2024 election.  We won the House.  We won the Senate, the White House, and the Electoral College and the popular vote in a landslide.  We also won all seven swing states, and all 50 states shifted in the Republican direction for the first time ever.  So, every state — every single state of the 50 states shifted Republican.  That’s never happened before.  Either way, it’s never happened.
And 85 percent of counties voted for Trump.  Think of that.  So, you have 2,600 counties versus 525.  Two thousand six hundred, think of that.  That’s why when you look at the election map, after it was all done — the certified map — the whole thing was red — 2,600 versus 500.  It’s a big, big dif- — nobody’s seen anything like it, actually.
So, as a result of this very historic victory, investors from all over the planet, once again, have confidence in America’s future and respect for America’s leaders, and it’s about time we get a little respect.
The last administration was the worst and most incompetent in the history of our country, but we are moving quickly to fix every single disaster Joe Biden created and make America stronger and more prosperous than ever before.  (Applause.)
Our first and most urgent mission is to remove the criminals that Biden allowed into our country with the ridiculous and very dangerous open-borders policy.  They came from all over the world.  They came from prisons and jails.  They came from mental institutions and insane asylums.  They were gang members.  They were drug lords.  They came from all over, and they were allowed to come into our country.  And we’re getting them out in record levels, just like they came in in record levels.
I want to thank Tom Homan and Kristi, who is just doing — she’s doing a fantastic job — governor of South Dakota — and Tom Homan, you know, and they are doing a fantastic job.  (Applause.)  And the results are incredible.
And every country is taking them back.  They’re sending their criminals to us, and they’re all taking them back.  We had a little problem with a couple of them.  That ended very quickly.  And because some said, “We don’t really want MS-13 back in our country.”  But I said, “Congratulations, you’re taking them back,” and they take them back.
And, by the way, Europe and other places ought to start also doing that.  They better start looking at immigration, because it’s really hurting Europe very, very badly.  And they better get smart and they better get tough before it’s too late.
We’re also working to end the highest inflation in our country’s history, all caused because they played with our energy policy and wasted money on the and other things such as that, and they wasted monies at — at never-seen-before levels.  If Joe Biden had simply held federal spending at the pre-pandemic levels we had in 2019, we — right now, we would have virtually no inflation.
We’re trying to balance the budget immediately, and because of the tariff income, which is really go- — it’s — it’s already turned out to be amazing, actually.  It’s really meant more for bringing countries and companies into our country, but it’s — the numbers are rather staggering, because we’re the big piggy bank that everybody wants to be.  And they can play games, and they can say, “Well, there’ll be retribution and, you know, equal this and that,” but they can’t be equal.
But we want to keep it so that we’re the big piggy bank.  And if we had years like we did the last four years, that wouldn’t have lasted too long.  So, we’re not promising it, but you know, all of these things could happen.  We — we hope to balance our budget.
So, I don’t want to promise it, because if I do and we come about $10 short, the fake news media back there would say, “We have breaking news.  He did not make it.  He did not make it.”
But we’ll get it done very soon.  It might not be this year, but it could be this year.  Actually, we have a chance at getting it even this year, which people would be shocked at, because they were talking about 10 years, 15 years, 20 years from now.
When I took office last month, we inherited the consequences of inflation that was more than four times what it was when I left four years ago.  Think of that, I left, it was at 1.4 percent.  And the annual government spending over $1.5 trillion more than projected in 2020 alone — $1.5 trillion.
But under the Trump administration, all of that is changing faster and more dramatically than anyone ever thought possible.  They didn’t think it was possible to do what we’ve done in just a very short period of time.  We’ve accomplished more in four weeks than most administrations accomplish in four years.
On my first day in office, I imposed an immediate federal hiring freeze, a federal regulation freeze, and a foreign aid freeze.
I signed an order creating the Department of Government Efficiency and put a man named Elon Musk in charge.  Thank you, Elon, for doing it.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.
And he’s doing a great job.  I wish you could have seen him last night.  It’s really — you know, he’s a very committed person.  He’s a very serious person.  And he’s a very high-IQ people.
You know, I like high-IQ people.  Not all have to be, but, you know, it’d be nice to have some people up there that — (laughter) — he’s a seriously high-IQ individual.  Now, he’s got his faults also, I will tell you that — (laughter) — but not too many of them.
Which is now really waging war on government waste, fraud, and abuse, and they’re curbing inflation and saving taxpayers billions and billions of dollars every single day.  And there’s even under consideration a new concept where we give 20 percent of the DOGE savings to American citizens and 20 percent goes to paying down debt, because the numbers are incredible, Elon.  So many billions of dollars — it’s billions — hundreds of billions, and we’re thinking about giving 20 percent back to the American citizens and 20 percent down to pay back debt — and pay down debt, which is — if you look at value, if it were a real estate balance sheet, the debt is tiny, but we still — we still want to pay it down.  Doesn’t matter.  We don’t look at it as a piece of real estate.  It’s America.  We’re going to get it down through intelligence, hard work, and, as Elon said, a word called “caring.”  You have to have — you have to care.
By doing this, Americans will tell us where there is waste.  They’ll be reporting it themselves.  They participate in the process of saving money.
So many of the men and women in this room, as an example, they pay tremendous amounts of taxes.  And here are just a few examples of where your money was going before I came along.  These are just some of the — just taken at random.  Oh, there are much worse examples than this.  I was just looking at them before the speech, and I can tell you there were much worse.  And there are some that are horrible, but I don’t want to really say them, because they’re very, very embarrassing to people — very, very embarrassing.  And they’re really something, but you’ll be seeing it and you will be reading about it.
But just some taking at random:
$2 million for sex change operations in Guatemala.
$20 million for “Sesame Street” performances in Iraq.  Twenty million, that’s a lot of money.  (Laughter.)  You know, I know what it costs to do those things.  You get a cast over for $50,000, give them a couple of bucks tip.  That’s it.  Not $20 million.  (Laughter.)  Twenty million, that’s “Gone With the Wind” on steroids.  (Laughter.)
$101 million for 29 diversity, equity, and inclusion contracts at the Department of Education.  Wow.
And we’ve also canceled — we’ve canceled all of these, saved all of this money.  And, again, this is just a small sample.  This could go on.  I could read them all day.
$520 million for a consultant — I want to know who is that consultant — (laughter) — to do ESG — that’s environmental, social, and governance — investments in Africa.
$25 million to promote biodiversity conservation and licit livelihoods by developing socially responsible behavior in Colombia.
$40 million to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants.  Nobody knows what that even means.  None of this stuff.  Nobody.  (Laughter.)  Everyone is trying to figure out, “What the hell does it all mean?”
$42 million for social and behavior changes in Uganda.  Forty million is a lot of newspaper ads in Uganda.  (Laughter.)
$70 million for research of evidence-based solutions for development challenges.
$10 million for Mozambique medical male circumcision.  (Laughter.)  What does that — what does that mean?
$2.3 million dollars for strengthening independent voices in Cambodia.  (Laughter.)
$14 million for improving public procurement in Serbia.
$486 million to the Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening, including $22 million for inclusion — inclusive and participatory political process in Moldova and $21 million for voter turnout in India.  What do we need to spend $21 million for voter turnout in India?  Wow, $21 million.  I guess they were trying to get somebody else elected.  Wow, we ought to tell the Indian government, because when we hear that Russia spent about two dollars in our country, it was a big deal.  Right?  (Laughter.)  They took — they took some Internet ads for $2,000.  This is a total breakthrough: twenty-one million dollars for India elections.
$29 million to strengthen the political landscape in Bangladesh.
conversion
$1.5 million for voter confidence in Liberia.  We need voter confidence too, when you read this list.  (Laughter.)
$14 million for social cohesion in Mali.
$2.5 million for inclusive democracies in South Africa.
$47 million for improving learning outcomes in Asia.  Asia is doing very well.  We don’t need to give them money.  (Laughter.)
And in another program, $50 million, plus another $50 million, for condoms for Hamas.  You know about that?  (Laughter.)  A hundred million dollars for condoms.  Condoms.  Does everybody know what a condom is?  (Laughter.)  For Hamas — $100 million.
incenduary
We’re also finding tremendous abuse, waste, and fraud in Social Security.  Social Security is — what’s happening there is going to be one of the great potential scandals in history.
On the program, there are over 4.7 million Social Security numbers from people from 100 years old to 109.  Think of that.  Now, over 100, there aren’t a lot of people that make it.  Hopefully most of the people in this room will make it, but historically, you don’t have thousands and thousands of people.  But listen to this: 3.6 million people are on Social Security rolls from the age of 110 years old to 119.  Do you think there are really that many?  (Laughter.)  Those people are seriously old.  (Laughter.)  But it gets worse.
3.47 million — 3.47 million people are on Social Security from the age of 120 years old to 129 years old.
3.9 million people are on the age of Social Security from 130 years old to 139 years old.  Now the all-time record, I heard, is a woman who was a hundred — she was 127 years old.  That’s the record.  A woman from a certain country where they have actually people that live pretty long, actually.  And she was 127 years old.  That’s pretty old, but we’re topping her by millions — millions of people.  (Laughter.)
3.5 million people from the age 140 to 149 years old.
1.3 million people are on Social Security from the age 150 to 159.
And over 130,000 people are on Social Security over the age of 160 years old — okay? — including 1,039 people — think of it — over 1,000 people — between the ages of 220 to 229.  (Laughter.)  And one person between the age of 240 to 249.
And the record-topper: There is one person on Social Security who is 360 years old — (laughter) — which is approximately 110 years older than our country.  (Laughter and applause.)

I said to Elon, “Who are these people that are doing this, the DOGE people?”  I said, “Who are they?  Where do they come from?”  He said, “Well, number one, they love our country, and, number two, they’re really genius at computers.”  So, nobody is going to fool them.  When they go in, they see some bureaucrat that’s scamming the country, and they try and talk about, you know, certain computer language, these people say, “No, it doesn’t work that way.”  These are people that are — have a natural ability as — as, you know, brilliant computer people.
It was very interesting when he told me that.  I said, “That’s what you need today.”
But all of these scams have now been terminated.
In addition, over the past month, we have effectively eliminated the U.S. Agency for International Development, which was funding much of this lunacy.  We virtually shut down the out-of-control CFPB, escorting radical-left bureaucrats out of the building and locking the doors behind them.  What they were doing was so terrible.  Where they were spending the money was so terrible.
What we haven’t looked at yet but will be is does the money come back to them, because nobody can be stupid like that.  And they’re not stupid.  They’re smart, actually.  And, you know, why are doing that?  Does money come back to them?  So, we’ll figure that out pretty easily, I think, and quickly.
But I’ve ended all of the so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion programs across the entire federal government and private sector and notified every single government DEI officer that their jobs have been deleted.  They’re all deleted.  And it’s interesting, even these country — these companies that have tremendous — the amounts of money — a number of them just announced — Walmart, if you can believe it, they just announced that they’re stopping.
And, you know, these companies are writing off, like, $220 million.  How can you spend that much money no matter what you’re doing?  If you’re teaching something, you’re going to have an instructor, you’re going to talk, you’re going to give them a book, “Please read the book.”  You know, and then you find they spent $225 million on that.  What’s going on?
And we were going in the wrong way, and our military was really — although, I tell you, you know, we — we defeated ISIS with our military in three weeks.  General “Razin” Caine was — he’s some general.  He’s a real general, not a television general.  And three weeks — ISIS.  And I — I asked him, and I saw some of his people that were so great, the soldiers.  We have the greatest military in the world, but we don’t have the greatest top, top leadership.  That’s why Afghanistan was such a horrible situation and so embarrassing and so many other things.
But when we want to, with proper leadership, there’s nobody even close to us.  We have the best equipment in the world.  We make the best equipment in the world.  But we have the best military, but, you know, we never fight to win.  We fight to just keep it going forever.  And when we fight to win, there’s nobody that can even come close to us.
But I was talking to General Dan Caine, and we call him “Razin” Caine.  And I was told it would take about four years to defeat ISIS, and he did it in three weeks.  I said to him, “What do you think, General?  How long will it take?”  “Sir, I think we should do it in less than four weeks.  You’re going to have time leftover.”  And he did.  He did that.  And we were told by the television generals it would take four years.
So, we did it.  That’s when I went to Iraq.  I flew to Iraq and — late at night — the dark of night, all the windows closed, all the lights off in the plane, in Air Force One.  And we flew in, and it was pretty amazing.  I’ll tell you, we were landing, and there were no lights.  No lights on the plane.  “Sir, we have to turn off all lights.”  I said, “You mean we spend $9 trillion, and we have to fly in on Air Force One with the lights off?”  And I went up to the pilot and said hello.
And, by the way, these guys are like central casting.  These are the best-looking human beings.  Everybody is, like, perfect.  (Laughter.)  The most handsome people, the best-looking people you’ve ever seen, with the flattops and the whole thing.
And I was a little concerned because the lights are off, and everything is off, and even the lights in where he was were down very dim — very, very dim with all of the lights on the fancy dashboards of the plane of Air Force One.
We’re getting a new Air Force One if they can ever finish the damn thing.  (Laughter.)  We’re getting two of them, actually.  But we may have to go a different route because it’s taking them a long time.  We’re going to get military that’s going to start building.  We’re going to get people to start building properly again in our country, because they don’t build properly.  (Applause.)  This was Boeing.
But we’re — we’re up there, and I’m looking at these people.  And, again, cent- — I say they look like Tom Cruise but better — (laughter) — stronger, tougher.  And I like Tom Cruise, but these are better.  And I said — I said, “Are we okay, Captain?”  “Yes, sir, we’re fine.”  But I’m looking out.  I don’t see any lights, and we’re landing. And I’m — you know, I’m used to that.  I like to sit with the pilots a lot, and I respect the pilots greatly.
And we’re up there, and, you know, we have the computer — I call it the computer voice, where it goes 1,000, 900, 800.  That’s feet — your feet above ground.  So, that means you’re very low.  And I’m looking out, and my eyes are pretty good, and I don’t see any lights.  And the computer goes out.  It sounds like a — an intelligent individual.  It goes, “1,000.”  We’re a thousand feet up.  That’s very — it’s a 10-story building.  This is a big, big plane.  And then it goes, “900, 800, 700.”  I say, “Captain.”  (Clears throat.)  (Laughter.)  “Captain, we don’t see any lights.”  I said, “Is everything” — “Yes, sir.  Everything is fine, sir.  We’ll be landing in three minutes.”
And then it goes, like, “600, 500.”  “Captain, are we okay?”  (Laughter.)  And then it goes, “400, 300, 200.”  And I’m saying, “Man, there’s nothing out there.”  (Laughter.)
And then he goes boom.  Perfect landing, right on this thing.  There are no lights on the runway.  There’s no n- — I don’t know how the hell they do it, but I’m sure as hell glad we had somebody that knows how to fly.  (Laughter.)
But they didn’t want to have any lights because they didn’t want the enemy — after spending, you know, years and trillions of dollars, we have to land with Air Force One with no lights on the runway.  But they were incredible people.
And then I got out of the plane, and I actually asked my people — you know, I said, “Excuse me, I was very brave sitting in that cockpit.  Am I allowed to give myself the Congressional Medal of Honor?”  (Laughter and applause.)  And they said, “I don’t think so, sir.”  I said, “Well, I felt I was extremely brave.”  (Laughter.)
But now here’s the problem with saying a story like that.  When you kid, the press will say, “President Donald Trump wanted to give himself the Congressional Medal of Honor.”  (Laughter.)   Headlines, you know?  Headlines all over the fake news.  We call it the fake news, but we’re all wise to them.
But it was something.
And then I went down, and it was the same thing.  I’m standing on the top, and I look down and there’s these handsome people.  Everybody is like from a movie set.  Good-looking guys.  I get down the stairs, and “What’s your name?”  “My name is Caine, sir.”  “What’s your first name?”  “They call me ‘Razin.’”  I say, “Wait a minute.  Your name is Razin Caine?  I love you.  I’ve been looking for you for five years.  You are the grea-” — (laughter) — “This is what I want.”
And there was a general next to him.  There was a colonel.  There was a drill sergeant, a master sergeant.  They were all, like, people — I could make a movie right now.  I’d have the best-looking people ever.  And they were great.
And then I went in, and “Sir, would you like to rest before the me-” — “No, I don’t want to rest.  I don’t want to rest.  I’ve been resting on the plane,” other than the last few moments, which were quite harrowing.  (Laughter.)  And I said, “I don’t want to rest.”  He was thinking about Biden in advance, you know?  Biden would have gone there; he would have rested for days.  (Laughter.)  They — and then they wouldn’t have had a meeting.  He’d just go home.  (Laughter.)
No, I said, “I don’t want to rest.  I don’t want to rest at all.  I want to go.”
So, we went into this, like, bunker, and we had a lot of very good, talented people.  And that’s when I asked him.  I said, “You know, I’m hearing it’s going to take a long time.”  “No, that’s not right, sir.  It’s not going to take a long time.  We’ll have it done in four weeks.”  I said, “How can you say four weeks when, in Washington, they said four years?”  He said, “It’s four weeks, sir.  We’ll hit them left.  We’ll hit them right.  We’ll hit them up the center.  We’ll hit them underground and overground.  We’ll knock the hell out of them, sir.”
And I said, “Why is it that they said so long?”  He said, “Because they wouldn’t let us fight, and we’re very far away.  They want us to fight for this — from this airport.  We’re very, very far away, sir, and they want us to fight here.  We have many substations out” — sub-airports, they call them.  Remote airports, where they build them in the sand.  “And we have many of them, and I’d use them all, sir, and I would hit them so hard from so many different directions.”
I said, “Well, what do you think?”  He said, “You just let me know.”  And I called him back, and I said, “Go ahead and do it.  Are you sure you can do this, General?”  He said, “Yes, sir.”  And he did it, actually, in three weeks.  It was over.  A hundred percent of people that are really hurting the Middle East, hurting the world — and it was done.
And we have — I’m telling you, we have the greatest military in the world, but you have to use the right people.  But there’s nothing like what they were able to do in that case.  And in other cases, wherever I gave them something, it was done incredibly well and very — and you know many of the instances, because it’s been well reported.
But we’ve also required — and we ha- — so, we have a country that’s a great country.  It’s a strong country, but it’s a country that’s just now gaining its respect back to the levels that it should — should have never lost.  We were being laughed at by the entire world, but we’re not being laughed at anymore.
But we’ve also required that all federal employees must once again show up to work.  This is a new phenomenon, you know, since COVID.  (Applause.)  Show up to work in person like the rest of us.  So, I mean, it doesn’t work when you don’t show up.
And I see companies now are all going back to it.  They’re all going back.  It’s great.  I want some of the big business leaders saying, “We absolutely are going back.”  You — you j- — you can’t work at home.  They’re not working.  They’re playing tennis, they’re playing golf, or they have other jobs, but they’re not working — or they’re certainly not working hard.  You could never build a company or a country with that.
So, we have a very strong policy.  And if they don’t show up to work, they — they get fired.
And we’re trying to make our government smaller but much stronger.  And we have tremendous bureaucracy, but it’s happening.  A lot of people are leaving and, in some cases, leaving with pretty good offers.  You know, you’re paid seven or eight months and go out, find a job.  But some of these people had jobs.  They were actually working for us, but they also had other jobs.  And those people, in theory, they have problems.  I don’t know if we’re going to do anything about that.  So, we have other things to do, but they were working other jobs instead of working for us.  So, they were staying home working, but they were working other jobs, getting paid a lot of money, perhaps.
We offered deferred resignation buyouts to all federal workers, resulting in more than 75,000 bureaucrats voluntarily surrendering their taxpayer-funded jobs.  A lot of them are leaving because they don’t want to be caught having the second job, some are leaving because they didn’t want to be in government any longer, and — and some are leaving because they didn’t want to show up to work.  They wanted to work outside of an office, and that’s never going to work for anybody, including companies.  The companies ought to get smart.
You watch these companies where they do that: They start going bad.  Nobody knows — “what’s wrong with this company?”  Well, try getting the people back into the office where they can be cohesive and together.
In less than a single month, the Department of Government Efficiency has already saved over 55- — this is just a short period of time — $55 billion, and we’re just getting started.  That’s nothing compared to the numbers that you’re talking about, right?  (Applause.)
We’re ending trillions of dollars in waste, and it’ll mean much lower inflation; lower interest rates; lower payments on mortgages, credit cards, car loans; and much higher stock markets.  I think the stock market is going to be great.  In other words, we will rapidly grow our economy by dramatically shrinking the federal government, and we have to do it.
I’m also taking fast action to end the radical left’s nation-wrecking crusade against oil and natural gas.  Over the past four years, the Biden administration cut the number of new oil leases and gas leases by 95 percent.  They slowed new pipeline.
I mean, look at the — any one.  Dakota Access, they wanted that one knocked out.  The Keystone Pipeline, they wanted that one knocked out.  They ended the Keystone.  We got the Dakota Access done, but it wasn’t easy after they tried to stop it.
They slowed new oil and gas pipeline construction to virtually a halt.  They shut down 38 percent of active oil and gas rigs in the United States.
But they love the wind turbines.  They go round and round and round.  And if the wind doesn’t blow, they got problems.  They kill all the birds.  They ruin the sight lines.  , including the oceans, the lakes.
They closed more than 50 power plants, all causing energy prices to skyrocket.  You saw that happen.  That’s what caused the inflation.  It’s pretty easy.
These policies were so destructive that despite draining nearly 40 percent of U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve meant for emergencies — it was meant for emergencies.  It wasn’t meant for getting the price of gasoline down so that you can win an election.  Didn’t work for winning the election.  Actually, there’s so many people that are driving that it’s a very small number.  It just had a very small effect.  But in the meantime, it takes it down.  It’s at — now it’s at the lo- — we’ll fill it up fast, but it’s at the lowest level.
When we made the transition, it was at the lowest level in history ever recorded.  It’s the lowest level.  Nobody’s ever seen it that way.  They — they put it all out because they thought they could keep gasoline prices down a little bit.  Just go past the election, and then after that, they didn’t care.  And it didn’t work, because they didn’t get elected.  I got elected.
But the price of gasoline still rose over 35 percent and, in some cases, at some periods, it was 100 percent and 125 percent during certain periods of time.
Under the Trump administration, we have implemented a very different plan.  You probably heard of it.  It’s called drill, baby, drill, and we’re doing a — (applause).
The world runs on low-cost energy, and energy-producing nations like us have nothing to apologize for.  We have more energy than any other nation in the world, and we’re going to use it.  And we’re going to use it on AI plants.
I was telling some of the people that came in that — you know, they’re very inter- — everybody’s talking about AI.  I hope you’re right.  You know, I don’t know.  Who knows?  (Laughter.)
But, Elon, are they right?  Are they right in going all i- — they are all in for AI.
But the problem is, to do it, just in our country, you need twice the electricity just to open up and be the top of AI.  You need twice the electricity that we have right now.  In the entire country, if you take all of the electricity, you need more than twice.  You need twice.  You need double what we have right now just to fuel this new industry that’s growing.  I was amazed when I heard that number.
And they all said, “How can we do this?”  Because, you know, in China and various other places, you can probably get it with the shake of a hand, but in our country, you can’t.
But now you can, because we’ve declared — I’m declaring a national emergency in order to get fast approvals.  And we’re going to have — if you build a plant, you’re able to build an electric-generating facility right next to your plant, so you’ll be making your own.  You won’t have to count on utilities.  You won’t have to count on an old grid that could fail, could get hit by something — bad things or good things — but you’re not going to have to — you’re not going to have to worry about grids.  You’re not going to have — you’ll build your plant, and you’ll build your — your — essentially, you become a utility, in a way.  You build your own electricity.  If you want to build extra and put it out and get paid for that, you’re going to be able to do that.  You could put it back into the grid, but you’re going to be able to build with your plant a generating facility.
And we’re going to get you Lee Zeldin, head of the environment — head of Environmental — the Environmental group — various groups.  And we’ve got them unified now, but we’re going to get you very fast approvals, and they’ll be approved so fast your head will spin.  And we’re going to get that whole industry started, and we’re going to be the head of it.  We’re leading right now.  We have the greatest brain power.  We’re leading right now, and I expect that we’re going to be leading by a lot.
But we’re going to get you the energy very, very quickly.  That would be the one thing that everybody was concerned, “How do we have that much electricity when Los Angeles has blackouts and brownouts right now, and there’s a lack of electricity?”  But we’re going to get it at levels never seen before.
I ended the ridiculous Green New Scam, halting tens of billions of dollars of wasteful deficit spending.  And I withdrew the United States from the unfair, one-sided Paris Climate Accord.
And I ended Joe Biden’s insane electric vehicle mandate, because it was just insane.  I repealed the last — and, by the way, if you want to buy an electric car, that’s great.  If you want to buy a gasoline-driven car or a hybrid, it’s great.  Whatever the — whatever the thing happens to be.
I heard hydrogen is hot.  The problem is, when it’s not, you’re in deep trouble.  Because when that sucker blows up, they don’t find the body.  (Laughter.)  So, that’s one that I said, “You know what?  Let’s take a pass on that one.”  They said it’s good, but when it’s bad, it’s really bad.  You find the bodies on trees — on the side of a tree.  (Laughter.)  I said, “I think we’ll pass on that one.  Right?  We’re not going to want that one.”  But you never know.  Maybe someday it’ll be good.  But it doesn’t sound like it’s off to a good start.
I repealed the last administration’s very destructive natural gas export ban, and, last week, we approved our first new liquefied natural gas export license, and we have literally hundreds of people that want to export.
I recently met with the Japanese prime minister, Ishiba, to discuss large increases in American oil and gas exports.  They want it so badly.  They said, “We went to the Biden administration, and they wouldn’t sell it.  They wouldn’t sell it.”  Nobody knows why.  Biden didn’t know why either.  They asked him.  “I don’t know.”  (Laughter.)  “He wanted — they did?  Oh, I didn’t know that.”
But we’re going to sell it.  And the new project in Alaska is going to feed all of Asia.  We’re going to take care of all of Asia.  We have so much oil and gas, like very few people — like very few countries have — like, really, actually, no country has.
I also met with Prime Minister Modi of India, who wants to greatly expand India’s purchase of American energy.
And my administration has also launched the most aggressive deregulation program of any nation in history.  Under my executive order, for every 1 new regulation added, 10 old regulations have to be eliminated.  (Applause.)
And, you know, in our first term, which was actually an incredible success — we had the greatest economy in history until COVID, and even after that, we did great.  The stock market was higher.  If you think of it, it was higher after the fact — after we went through that whole thing, it was higher than it was just prior to COVID coming in, which is a pretty amazing thing.
But we did a great job on that, but it was a terrible thing for the world.  The whole world suffered.  It suffered terribly, including China, including other countries.  It just was a terrible period of time.
But despite that, we did well.  But we had the greatest economy in the history of our country, and I think this time we’re going to do even better.  We had — we were artificially hurt by COVID.  We had to focus on that instead of focusing on — but just prior to COVID coming in, there’s never been anything like what we did, what we achieved.  And even after, we did very well con- — and especially considering what all of us had to do with COVID.  Some nations were hit so badly, it was — it was just unbelievable what happened to them.
As part of our effort, I’ve signed executive orders to keep the United States at the forefront of artificial intelligence and to end Joe Biden’s war on Bitcoin and crypto.  We ended that war totally.  That war is over.  They were very hostile toward them until the very end, just because there are so many people on Bitcoin and crypto that — just before the end, the SEC came out, and they were being very nice.  I was so nice to people, because so many people were being indicted for no reason whatsoever — very political group of people.  That’s all they did was they liked indicting people.
But they were being indicted, and many of those indictments were dropped just before the election because they said, “Wait a minute.  There’s 100 million, 125 million people using this,” and they didn’t want to have, you know, all these people being — voting against.  But by the time they did that, it was too late.  We had that vote entirely, I think.  I think anybody would — smart that believed in that, and there were a lot of people believing it — anybody that was smart voted for Trump.
And they pulled the indictments.  And I see people that were indicted.  I said, “I saved your life.  I saved your life.”  Because if they thought that — they actually thought that I was doing — they said, “Why is Trump doing it?  Is he doing it for political reasons?”  I don’t do anything for political reasons.  I do what’s right.  I do — I want to be on the forefront of every industry.  (Applause.)
So, I’ll be working with the Republican Congress to pass the largest tax cuts in American history.  And that includes, obviously — (applause) — yeah.  That includes we have to extend the Trump tax cuts, which were, until now, the largest.
We’re going to dramatically cut taxes for families and for workers and for companies, including no tax on tips and hopefully no tax on Social Security and no tax on overtime.  And that overtime one is a sleeper, because I think a lot of people are going to be spurred on to do a lot of extra work.  When they hear that, it’s — a lot of companies really like it and a lot of people really like it.
The new Trump tax cuts will also include 100 percent expensing for new factory construction in the United States and anything else that you’re going to buy with capital.  If you buy something — if you buy something that is going to be good for our country, we’re going to let you expense it — one-year expense.  (Applause.)  And I did that the first time, and everybody was saying, “Can you go back to that?”  Now you still get, I guess, 40 percent or whatever, but it, you know, pares down.  But we’re going to bring that right up to the — to the top level.  I think that had a lot to do with the success that I had during my first term.
And we’ll substantially cut taxes for all domestic producers of oil and gas and just about everything else that they produce.
In my first term, I brought the business tax down from around 40 percent to 21 percent, which everybody said was an impossible thing to do.  I cut it from 40 or — it actually — with state and city, it was much higher than 40, but I got it down to 21 percent.  And now I’m bringing it down to a goal of 15 percent, but only if you make your product in America.  In other words, you’re going to be at 21 percent, but if you make your product in America, you’re going to go from 21 to 15.  If you don’t, you’re going to pay 21 percent, which is still lower than anything.  (Applause.)
So, guys like Elon are going to come and make his great cars in the United States.  There — a lot of — a lot of people will.  A lot of people are calling.  A lot of car companies are calling.  They called me — three of them.  Three of the majors, they called, and they said, “We’re looking all over the place.  We want to be there.”
I’m going to be announcing tariffs on cars and semiconductors and chips and pharmaceuticals — drugs and pharmaceuticals and lumber, probably, and some other things over the next month or sooner, and it’s going to have a big impact on America.  We’re bringing our businesses back.
If they don’t make their product in America, then they — very simply, they have to pay a tariff.  But if they do make their product in America, they ha- — they don’t have to pay any tariff, which will bring — it’s all going to bring trillions of dollars into our Treasury, or it’s going to mean that there won’t be any taxes because we won’t have a fair base.  If they don’t have it, we don’t have it.  If they don’t pay — if they don’t charge us, we don’t charge them.  It’s pretty simple.
The Republican Party is, once again, the party of common sense.  We’re a party of common sense.  We want strong borders.  We don’t want men playing in women’s sports.  We don’t want to have transgender for everybody.  We’re the party of common sense.  That’s how we won the election in such a big manner.
We’ll no longer allow other countries to ransack and plunder our nation.  That’s why I’ve announced that we will soon begin imposing reciprocal tariffs on any country that engages in unfair and unequal trading practices.  If they tariff us, as I said, we will tariff them at the exact same rate.  So, if a certain country — because some of these countries, even countries that I’ve already mentioned, are extremely aggressive with tariffs.  Nobody knows that.
The European Union, they have a VAT tax that’s devastating.  It’s very tough for people on the outside.  Hard to sell cars.  Really impossible to sell them, because they also have nonmonetary tariffs that are very, very tough.  But if you take a look at that, it’s a very unfair situation.  And the VAT tax is similar to the tariff.
Around the world, I’m moving quickly to end wars, settle conflicts, and restore the planet to peace.  I want peace, and I don’t want to see these — everybody being killed.  And you take a look at the death in the Middle East and the death that’s taking place between Russia and Ukraine that’s been going on, and we’re going to end it.
There’s no profit for anyone in having World War III, and you’re not so far away from it.  I’ll tell you right now, you’re not so far away.  If we would have had this administration for another year, you would have been in World War III, and now it’s not going to happen.
NA
And we’ve secured a ceasefire in Gaza, and we’re bringing in the hostages, and we’re bringing them home to their families.  Some of them are in pretty bad shape, I have to tell you.
To end the horrible war in Ukraine, I have spoken with President Putin and President Zelenskyy, and our teams began negotiations this week in Saudi Arabia.  I want to thank Saudi Arabia for that.  That was so great.  (Applause.)  Yeah.
And I want to thank, in particular — I mean, we have so many of the people — Yasir, Mohammed, all the people — but — but, in particular, we have to thank Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for hosting these historic talks — (applause) — and talks that went very, very well.
Steve was there — Steve Witkoff was there, and Michael was there — Michael Waltz — and others.  And they really went well.  It’s a big — it’s a big step.  We’ve got to get that war over with.
You have to see the people that are dying.  I look at the pictures, the — the satellite pictures of the field.  It’s a level field, and it looks like a modern-day version of Gettysburg, and you know what that means.  It is just carnage.  It’s horrible.
And, you know, it’s not American soldiers.  It’s not even soldiers from the Middle East, in the case of Ukraine-Russia, but it’s people.  It’s young people from Russia and Ukraine, mostly, that are just being decimated.  It’s flat fields, and a bullet goes, and a bullet only stops when it hits somebody.  And the level of people being killed in that battle — soldiers, young soldiers — in some cases, old soldiers, because they’re running out of people; they’re running out of soldiers, one case.
a modestly successful comedian, President Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 billion to go into a war that basically couldn’t be won, that never had to start, and never would have started if I was president — not even a chance.  And it didn’t start for four years.  Never would have started.
But a war that he, without the U.S. and Trump, will never be able to settle.  They’ll never settle that war without our involvement.  That’s why they did such a great job this weekend.  That’s why Saudi Arabia did such a great job this weekend in hosting.
The United States has spent $200 billion more than Europe, and Europe’s money is guaranteed.  They get their money back.  It’s a form of a loan.  Nobody knows that.  I know that.  I said, “Why isn’t somebody saying, you know, we do it the same way?”  And we spent much more money.  We have to equalize.
But while the United States gets nothing back — so, they get their money back.  It’s a loan.  We just give our money.
And we had a deal based on rare earth and things, but they broke that deal.  But we — they broke it two days ago.  We had a deal, because I said, “We’re spending $350 billion, and Europe gets their money back in the form of a loan and we don’t.  We’re just giving the money hand over fist.”  That’s the Biden administration for you.  But they’re no longer dealing with the same United States as they were dealing with a few months ago.  Why didn’t crooked Joe Biden demand equalization?
And that this war is far more important to Europe than it is to us, and that there’s a very big, beautiful ocean as separation.  This is — you know, we’re helping Europe.  We’re trying to help Europe.
On top of this, Zelenskyy admits that half of the money that we sent them is missing.  They don’t know where the money is.  He said, “Well, we don’t know where half of it is.”  That’s great.  Wonderful.  (Laughter.)
He refuses to have elections.  He’s low in the real Ukrainian polls.  I mean, how can you be high with every city is being demolished?  It’s hard to be high.  Somebody said, “Oh, no, his polls are good.”  Give me a break.  (Laughter.)  Every city is being demolished.  They look like a demolition site, every single one of them.
And the only thing he was really good at was playing Joe Biden like a fiddle.  He played him like a fiddle.  That’s an expression we use, Yasir, to say that he’s pretty easy.  Pretty easy.  (Laughter.)
A dictator without elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he’s not going to have a country left.  Got to move.  Got to move fast, because that war is going in the wrong direction.
In the meantime, we’re successfully negotiating an end to the war with Russia — something all admit that only Trump is going to be able to do and the Trump administration.  We’re going to be able to do it.  I think Putin even admitted that.
Biden never tried.  Europe has failed to bring peace.  And Zelenskyy probably wants to — maybe he wants to keep the gravy train going.  I don’t know what’s the problem, but he hasn’t been able to — he’s very upset that he wasn’t invited — he could have come if he wanted to — but that he wasn’t invited to Saudi Arabia.  But he’s been working for three years.  There’s never been even meetings or phone calls to stop this war.
It’s a horrible thing.  I figure Russia has lost 900,000 soldiers.  I think that Ukraine has lost probably 700,000, and it’s a terrible thing.  You’ll see body parts — bodies and body parts all over the field.  All over.  We see them through — very accurately through satellites.
I love Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job.  His country is shattered, and millions and millions of people have unnecessarily died.  And you can’t bring a war to an end if you don’t talk to both sides.  You got to talk.  They haven’t been talking for three years.
So, we hope to see a ceasefire soon and to reestablish stability in Europe and the Middle East.  (Applause.)
But as I — thank you very much.  And as I’ve said before, it’s my hope that my greatest legacy will be as a peacemaker and a unifier.  That would be a great legacy.  (Applause.)
So, in conclusion, the golden age of America is upon us, and I’m inviting everyone here today and every citizen across our land to take part in the most extraordinary period of peace, prosperity, growth, innovation, wealth creation, and expansion the world has ever seen.
We’re on our way.  I mean, everyone is talking about us.  Three weeks.  We’re in there for a couple of days more than three weeks, and everyone is talking about it.  You have to see the crowds of people outside.  It’s pretty amazing what’s happening.
We’re on the verge of soaring markets, surging incomes, booming production, groundbreaking technologies, thrilling discoveries, and a quantum leap in the quality of life.  Absolutely, a quantum leap.
One day very soon, our country will have the greatest economy in the history of the world, because we once again have a president who puts America first.  And we put America first, and your country should put your country first, but in the end, we want America first.  And when it’s all beautiful, which it’s going to be pretty soon, we want to help other countries and you want to help other countries.
But, you know, I tell your leaders — and some of the leaders are in this room right now — you got to put your country first.  Whether it’s Saudi Arabia, whether it’s something else, you’re going to put your country first, but we’re going to have plenty left over to help others also.
As long as you invest in America, build in America, and hire in America, that means that I’m fighting for you.  I am fighting very hard for you.
Together, we’re going to make the United States of America bigger, better, bolder, richer, and greater than ever before.  It’s going to be stronger than ever before.  We’re going to be a peacemaker and a peacekeeper.  We’re going to stop people from these stupid, never-ending wars.  We’re not going to partake in them ourselves, but we’ll be stronger and more powerful than anybody by far.  And if it ever came to war, there is nobody that will be able to come close to us, but we don’t think that’s going to ever happen.
So, I want to thank you all very much.  It’s a great honor to be here.
And I think somebody said they’re going to ask questions, and I didn’t say, “Gee, what are the questions,” like Biden does.  I say, “Just ask.  It doesn’t matter.”  You ask a question, and I give an answer.
So, I think, Richard, you’re going to come up and you’re going to give me some questions.
Thank you very much.  (Applause.)
MR. ATTIAS:  Thank you.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  Please, a round of applause for the president of United States of America.  Thank you.  (Applause.)
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
MR. ATTIAS:  Mr. President, thank you for accepting to take a few questions.  Twenty years ago, I don’t know if you will remember, we were under the same roof in Orlando, and you were delivering an amazing speech in front of 3,000 sales rep, giving them the best advice to be successful.  So, what is the best piece of advice that you have ever received?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think it was watching my father.  You know, my father was a very hard worker, and he just worked hard and he was very smart.  He had good genetics.  His brother was the longest-serving professor in the history of MIT, Dr. John Trump.  And my father was every bit as smart, but my father was — had to work.
He was older, and he put his brother through school.  In fact, he once said, “Boy, I put him through so much school.”  He had three different degrees, and they asked him to stay on at MIT.  But my father was the same ilk.
And I noticed that my father was a happy man, and what he did is he worked.  He just worked all the time.  He worked, worked, worked, and he loved it.
And, really, I think the best piece of advice I got from that is you have to love what you do, and if you love what you do, you’re going to have a happy life.  If you don’t — I mean, I see so many people, they’re in businesses that they don’t want to be in.  They’re in businesses that, you know, they’re bored in or they’re not good at, they don’t have a natural ability at it.  There is such a thing as natural ability, whether it’s sports or acting or anything else.  I mean, some people have an ability for something.  Try and find that ability.
But you have to love what you do.  If you love what you do, you’re going to be — at least you have a good chance of being successful.
MR. ATTIAS:  Mr. President, it’s almost time for — (applause) — for an early dinner.  So, if you are throwing a dinner party, and you can invite three fascinating guests, living or dead, who would you bring?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, they’re all sitting right in the front row.  (Laughter and applause.)  Yasir, are you ready? Mohammed, are you ready?  Steve Witkoff.
And we have Mr. — the most important person, at least until the World Cup is over, is here.  Gianni, stand up.  He gave the United States the World Cup.  (Applause.)  Gianni, thank you very mu- — I didn’t know you were here.  That’s very good.  He’s the king of soccer.  That’s not bad.  And you’ve done a fantastic job.
You know, but it’s very interesting, when I was president, I got the World Cup and I got all of the — you know, we have the 250 anniversary, so that fell in this administration.  That’s a big deal: 250 years.  But we have all of these things happening, and I also got the Olympics.
And I was called by the mayor of Los Angeles, “Sir, would you call up the Olympic Committee because” — it was at that time — “President Obama will not take their phone call.  And we’re going to get the Olympics in Los Angeles.”
And, by the way, they’ve recommitted to Los Angeles at a level that — you know, I was very worried about that.  And they’ve — the opposite.  You know, somebody could have said, “Well, we’re going to do it someplace else until” — they have actually recommitted.  They’re going to make it bigger and better than ever.  So, I want to let you know that.  (Applause.)
But I got — I had the Olympics.  So, I got the Olympics.  I got the World Cup, and I said — and the 250, but that one I didn’t get.  But it was there.  It was in this term.
And I ran an election, and we did fantastic in 2016.  We did much better — millions and millions — tens of millions, but millions and millions of votes better.  And bad things happened, and I didn’t get that one.
And I said, “You know” — when I originally signed the Olympics, I said, “I won’t be able to even be president, and I got the Olympics,” because if I didn’t — when I spoke with the people — the organizing committee and the people in different parts of the world — they asked me to do it because the president wouldn’t do it.  I was president-elect, and I gave them a talk.  I couldn’t get them off the phone.  They were starving for love.  And the bottom line: They gave us the Olympics.
And I said, “You know, isn’t it sad I won’t be president?”  Then we had the election result, and now I’m president for the Olympics and for the World Cup.  (Applause.)  So, I’m very happy about that, Gianni.  Thank you very much.
Thank you, G- — (laughs) — I’ll be there.  I promise, I’ll be there.
MR. ATTIAS:  And, by the way, Mr. President, backstage, you have a gift from Gianni.  He gave us the first ball with your name —
THE PRESIDENT:  Ooh —
MR. ATTIAS:  — which will be played for the cup — World Cup in America.
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s great.  It’s going to be great.  Thank you, Gianni, very much.  (Applause.)
MR. ATTIAS:  I doubt that any day you will take a sabbatical year, but if you could take a sabbatical year, Mr.  President, what unconventional thing would you do?
THE PRESIDENT:  What was the word?
MR. ATTIAS:  Sabbatical.  You don’t work for one year.
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, sabbatical.  I thought — thought you said “sabbath.”  (Laughter.)  That’s a big difference.  It’s almost the opposite, when you think about it.  Right?  (Laughter.)
I think what I’d do is — look, what I’m doing now is the most exciting job in the world.  It’s a hard job, not an easy job.  It’s a nasty job.  It could be a lot easier with — you know, I — I think that the — the news media has to straighten themselves out, because people are getting it.  You know, they — they’re losing tremendous popularity, and they’ve lost their prestige and they’ve lost their credibility.  And I think it’s a very important thing, the news media, but I think they have to straighten themselves out, because the people are going around them.
Now, they have so many different things with — like Elon with X, which was a big — a big thing.  And we have Truth, which has been fantastic.  And we have so many other things that you don’t really need traditional.
But I — I will tell you that there is just nothing I could do to enjoy my life, whether it’s that or anything else that you’d ask, because this is the ultimate.  I mean, I had to make a big decision, and it was a very risky decision, because if I would have lost, my life would have been a much different life.  It would have been a very nasty life.  They were going after me at levels that nobody has ever seen before — not Andrew Jackson, not Abraham Lincoln.
You know, the historians say that the president that was treated the worst by far by the media and overall was Andrew Jackson.  In fact, his wife died of heartbreak.  They were treated really rough.  And Abraham Lincoln was second, but he had a civil war.  You know, you can understand that.
But nobody was treated like me.  Nobody.  And I will tell you, you learn a lot about yourself.  But there’s nothing I’d rather do.
I had to make a decision: Do I do this?  Because if I lost, it would have been very, very bad.  It was dangerous, actually.  Very dangerous in so many different ways.
And I decided to do it.  And I said, “I have to win, because if I don’t” — when I spoke to a friend of mine the other night, he said, “You know, if you lost, it would have been very” — it was actually Sean Hannity, just before we did the interview last night.  He said, “Boy, if you would have lost, it would have — you would have had a tough life.  You would have had a very tough life.”
So, it was — there was a certain amount of courage involved in this decision to run.  And it’s a great honor to win by this much — to win all seven swing states, the popular vote.
Popular vote doesn’t get won that much by Republicans, for whatever reason.  I think that’s changing, because, again, we’re the party of common sense and they’re the party of some real bad things.
And I think they’ll change.  I think they have to change.  It would be wonderful.  I’m going to be having lunch with some of the Democrats next week, and it would be wonderful if we could work together.  I think working together would be great.  But they have to change.  You can’t get elected on the programs that they want, and that’s one of — that’s really what America wants to see.
So, there’s nothing I’d rather do than what I’m doing right now.  (Applause.)
MR. ATTIAS:  When we started this conference — Mr. President, when we started this conference, Yasir and I, His Royal Highness Crown Prince told us, “I want that to be the place where people will come to understand where to invest in terms of geographies and sector.”  So, what is the best investment you have made in your personal growth, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I was involved in real estate from, you know, most of my life and was — you know, guys like Witkoff will tell you I was really good at it and I was successful at it — very successful at it.  I’ve been involved in things prior to being president, but during the four years — during the last four years, you know, I followed sort of the trends, and I’ve made a lot of money with following some of these trends.
And, you know, it’s — again, it’s something that you do.  You — it’s — I really believe that some people have instinct.  I think I’ve always had an instinct for making money.  I make money.
And I went into show business.  I had one of the most successful shows on television.  I wrote books, and they were all bestsellers.  Virtually every book a bes- — was a big bestseller, some really big bestsellers.
And so, I don’t know, it’s — whatever I do, I just want to make it successful.  It’s very important to me.
There are many ways to make money.  You can be in many different fields, and a lot of them is being in the right country.  You know, if you’re in a certain country — our country was actually getting very bad — a very dangerous place, actually.  Bad things were happening.  But if you’re in a certain country, you have a chance to do well.  And no matter how good you are, if you were born into the wrong country, you’re not going to make money.
Now, you can do other things.  You can attain power, I guess.  Maybe it’s the wrong kind of power, but it’s power.  But being in the right country, where you have the right incentives and, you know, entrepreneurship, et cetera.
And America has always been sort of at the top — or one of the top, but always pretty much at the top.  But it was losing that — it was losing that position and, I think, losing it rapidly.
This last administration — look, I don’t want to be — I wish I could say I — I wouldn’t have run if — if I thought Biden was doing a good job, if I thought they were — I wouldn’t have run, because, as I said, it was very dangerous to run in a lot of ways.  In fact, my ear will show that when you look at it closely.  My ear — I have that throbbing feeling every once in a while.  But it was dangerous in a lot of different ways.  But he was so bad that I had no choice but to do it.
If I thought he was doing a great job, I wouldn’t have run, and I would be very happy.  I actually wanted him to do a good job.  I was saying, “Do this.  Do that.”  I’m telling them do things.  They should have done what I said.  And — but I would have been — I would have been very happy not to have run and, frankly, to have seen somebody do a good job.  But our country was going to hell, and I really sort of had to run.
MR. ATTIAS:  If you were a historical ruler, would you prefer to rule during war or peace?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I — I’d — I want to be, again, a peacemaker and I want to keep us out of war.  But sometimes, to do that, you have to have a very strong country.  You have to have a very strong military.  And as I said, we have a much stronger military than anyone would know.
We have the best equipment, and I bought a lot of it.  I rebuilt our military in the first four years.  I rebuilt it.  We gave a lot of it away to Afghanistan, to the Taliban, stupidly — but that’s a very small amount, relative.  It was billions and billions, but it’s still a very small amount relatively to what we built.  But I rebuilt — largely rebuilt our military.
Now I’m going to have to do it again, because so much has been given away, so much has been treated so badly.
And — but to keep peace, you really have to — I have a thing: strength through — and I mean it, you really have it.  You have strength, and you need the strength, but it’s really peace through strength, because without the strength, it’s going to be very hard to have peace because you’re going to be taken over, bad things are going to happen.  So, you really want to have peace through strength, and that’s where I’ve done it.
Having strength, having power, in that sense, to protect yourself and your people is a very important thing.  Hopefully, you don’t have to use that power.
I will tell you, I was dealing with President Putin very successfully on denuclearization.  We were talking about it very seriously, and then COVID came and lots of things came.  And we had also talked to China about it.
Now, Russia and us have the biggest nuclear by far.  China is not close, but they will be close.  In three or four years or five years, they’ll be equal.  But we were going to talk to China, and I spoke to President Xi about it very successfully.  I think we were going to denuclearize it.  We were — had to get the smaller nuclear powers, of which there are four — three, maybe, but four probably — to do something.  We would have been able to do that.  But I was having very strong talks with President Putin about denuclearization.
And, you know, if you’re president, you get presentations about what we’re building; what we’re having; the power of weapons; the power of many things besides weapons, per se.
When I saw the power of nuclear weapons — and we can never let that happen.  If that happens, the ball game will be — the world will be destroyed.  The power is so enormous.  You look at Hiroshima, you look at Nagasaki — multiply that times 500 times, and the world would be destroyed.
So, you want somebody as your president or you want somebody as your leader that understands that.  We just can’t let that happen.
We can’t let other countries get nuclear weapons — not only Iran.  Iran is a good example, and maybe the one that people think about, but we can’t let that happen.
The power of weaponry today is so enormous that the world — the world would disintegrate.  So, we can’t let it happen.
MR. ATTIAS:  Mr. President, if you had to describe United States of America in just three words, what would they be?
THE PRESIDENT:  In three words?
MR. ATTIAS:  Three words.
THE PRESIDENT:  Love, respect, and strength.  (Applause.)
That’s a tough question.  That might be my best answer, Yasir.  That’s — that reminds me of high school, that one.  But that may have been the toughest question, actually.
Do you think Joe Biden could have done that?  I don’t think so.  (Laughter.)  I don’t think so.
MR. ATTIAS:  We’re almost at the end, Mr. President.  But talking about United States of America, what is one cultural habit in the Uni- — in the U.S. business that the rest of the world could learn from?  What is the best practice that (inaudible).
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think we love our families, but I think a lot of the world loves their families, you know?
I was speaking to the head of Mexico, because I complain constantly about people pouring in.  Now our border is the strongest border we’ve ever had.  We’ve gone from the worst border ever in history to the strongest border.  But I was speaking to the president of Mexico — a very wonderful woman, actually — and I said — we were talking about drugs — “You can’t let people come through your country and come into the country.”  You know, I was not that nice, but they understood what I was saying.
And she said something that really got me.  She said — I said, “Are you a — you’re not a big drug-taking nation?”  And she said, “No, we are not a consumer.”  And I said, “A consumer.  What a — you know, an interesting word.  ‘We’re not a consumer nation.  We’re not a consumer of drugs.’”  I said, “What an interesting — and why — why is that?”  He said — she said, “Well, we have very strong family values.”  I said, “But we do too.  We do too.”  We have very strong — our families are devastated by what’s happening with fentanyl.
And China will not be doing — we’re going to make a deal with China.  We’re not letting that happen anymore.  And I had a deal — by the way, before I left, I had a deal with President Xi where they were going to give the maximum penalty to anybody making fentanyl and sending it into the United States, and their maximum penalty is the death penalty.  And it would have stopped.  But when the election turned out to be a rigged election — but that’s okay — when election turned out to be — it was an election that shouldn’t have happened.
All the — all the things that happened — I give you an example: We wouldn’t have had October 7th Israel attack.  We wouldn’t have had Ukraine and Russia fighting.  We wouldn’t have had inflation.  We wouldn’t have had all of these things that, you know, happened.
But in speaking with her — she said about family values —  I said, “Well, you’re not really saying anything there, because we have great families too.  We have great family values.”  She said, “Plus, we advertise a lot.”  I said, “Ooh.  You mean you advertise about how bad drugs are?”  “Yes, we do.  We spend a lot of money on advertising.”  And I said, “Unbelievable.”
That was such a great conversation, because we’re going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars advertising how bad drugs are so that kids don’t use them — that they chew up your brain; they destroy your teeth, your skin, your everything.  (Applause.)
And I thanked her for that.  You know, I — I make so many calls, and I never learn anything from anybody.  I know everything, and I never learned anything from anybody.  (Laughter.)  And I spoke to this woman — as soon as she said it — she didn’t have to say exactly what — I said, “Exactly.  What a great idea.”
And I think we’re going to have a — and I saw pieces of it.  We’re going to go in with $100 million and then another $100 million initially.  But I saw some of the ads, and they are really violent.  I said, “You have to make them strong.”  Your skin practically comes off after a period of time.  You lose your hearing.  You — you lose your teeth.  You lose — I mean, you — it — it is terrible, and we show this happening to people.
And I think we’re going to — you know, we — we did very well with — we had blue-ribbon committees, headed up by the first lady of the United States and a lot of other people that — you know, they have no idea the viciousness of these cartels and these people.  And they’re smarts.  I mean, they’re very smart, tough people — making a fortune, by the way — an absolute fortune.
But we got it down 18 percent, which was a record.  But 18 percent is not great, when you think about it.  I think we could get it down 50 or 55 or maybe even 60 percent with advertising.
So, she really gave me something.  I — I was going to call her and tell her that she did, but now I don’t have to call her because she’s going to be seeing this right now.  (Laughter.)
So, to the president of Mexico: Thank you very much.  I appreciate it.
But we’re going to do a great advertising campaign saying how bad it is, how drugs are so bad for you.  (Applause.)
MR. ATTIAS:  My last question, Mr. President.  You have mentioned briefly in your speech about the legacy.  What would you like your legacy to be, if you can tell us more about it?
THE PRESIDENT:  That I came into a country that was great but is in trouble, and I made America great again, and I got it out of trouble.  And people respect America now.  And we were a country of peace, and we brought peace to the rest of the world.  (Applause.)
MR. ATTIAS:  Thank you.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  (Applause.)
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everybody.  Thank you.  (Applause.)

build the future push boundaries unleash breakthroughs transform industries and make a fortune because you want to make fortune most of you have already made a fortune i don t want to say laughter there is no better place on earth than the current and future united states of america under a certain president named donald j trump i think that you re going to do very well applause they re saying that november th election day will go down as one of the most important days in the history of our country they said in years the most consequential election i don t know if they re right about that or not but it sounds good i wanted to see if i could get a couple of more years tacked on but i figured the fight wasn t really worth it one hundred and twenty nine is a lot and as of january th the dark days of high taxes crushing regulations rampant inflation flagrant corruption government weaponization ooh i know about weaponization and total incompetence will be gone forever will be gone forever applause because the united states is back and open for business and the golden age of america has officially begun you see it happening applause since my election america s economic engines have come roaring back to life in just a very short period of time think of it from november th the the progress that s been made has been amazing the nasdaq is up nearly percent in just a few months and that s a lot the dow jones industrial average is up points and bitcoin has set multiple all time record highs because everyone knows that i m committed to making america the crypto capital we want to stay we want to stay at the forefront of everything and one of them is crypto and miami seems to be the center of the action come to think of it and maybe it ll stay there business optimism skyrocketed points think of that in a single month the most in history by far that s the biggest increase in history by not even close the ism index of manufacturing activity surged into positive territory for the first time in many years amazing and it was just announced this is an interesting one i didn t realize it was that bad for so long but it was just announced by one of the nation s most historically accurate and respected pollsters rasmussen that the number of americans who believe our country is on the right track now exceeds those who think it s heading in the wrong direction for the first time in years can you believe you that twenty years applause and this is really a seismic point swing from just before the election that s nobody has ever seen anything like that one yasir i want to tell you that s a big one laughter the best and most successful business leaders on earth are now racing to invest in the united states since november damac has announced plans to invest $ billion in the u s creating at least jobs softbank has announced investments of between $ and $ billion creating at least american jobs oracle and openai and softbank are now collectively committing $ billion to keep the united states on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence and so many more i mean so many companies they want to come to the white house and have a little news conference all the time i said why don t you just announce it but they want to come and i ll do that i don t mind doing that i say anytime they want to go $ billion or more i m i m there laughter and applause ten billion or more but on his recent visit to the white house the prime minister of japan announced he anticipates japanese investment in the united states of well over a trillion dollars and we re working on an alaska pipeline already which is the closest point to asia and as you know the anwr which we ve started ronald reagan couldn t get it approved nobody could get it approved for so many years couldn t get it approved i got it approved actually i got it approved twice i got it approved and biden ended it that was a shocker but we just got it approved again and we re going to be applause it s it s probably the largest deposit maybe anywhere in the world just by itself it s they say of similar size to saudi arabia so we hope that s correct but all of this is only happening because of the world changing results of the election we won the house we won the senate the white house and the electoral college and the popular vote in a landslide we also won all seven swing states and all states shifted in the republican direction for the first time ever so every state every single state of the states shifted republican that s never happened before either way it s never happened and percent of counties voted for trump think of that so you have counties versus two thousand six hundred think of that that s why when you look at the election map after it was all done the certified map the whole thing was red versus it s a big big dif nobody s seen anything like it actually so as a result of this very historic victory investors from all over the planet once again have confidence in america s future and respect for america s leaders and it s about time we get a little respect the last administration was the worst and most incompetent in the history of our country but we are moving quickly to fix every single disaster joe biden created and make america stronger and more prosperous than ever before applause our first and most urgent mission is to remove the criminals that biden allowed into our country with the ridiculous and very dangerous open borders policy they came from all over the world they came from prisons and jails they came from mental institutions and insane asylums they were gang members they were drug lords they came from all over and they were allowed to come into our country and we re getting them out in record levels just like they came in in record levels i want to thank tom homan and kristi who is just doing she s doing a fantastic job governor of south dakota and tom homan you know and they are doing a fantastic job applause and the results are incredible and every country is taking them back they re sending their criminals to us and they re all taking them back we had a little problem with a couple of them that ended very quickly and because some said we don t really want ms back in our country but i said congratulations you re taking them back and they take them back and by the way europe and other places ought to start also doing that they better start looking at immigration because it s really hurting europe very very badly and they better get smart and they better get tough before it s too late we re also working to end the highest inflation in our country s history all caused because they played with our energy policy and wasted money on the and other things such as that and they wasted monies at at never seen before levels if joe biden had simply held federal spending at the pre pandemic levels we had in we right now we would have virtually no inflation we re trying to balance the budget immediately and because of the tariff income which is really go it s it s already turned out to be amazing actually it s really meant more for bringing countries and companies into our country but it s the numbers are rather staggering because we re the big piggy bank that everybody wants to be and they can play games and they can say well there ll be retribution and you know equal this and that but they can t be equal but we want to keep it so that we re the big piggy bank and if we had years like we did the last four years that wouldn t have lasted too long so we re not promising it but you know all of these things could happen we we hope to balance our budget so i don t want to promise it because if i do and we come about $ short the fake news media back there would say we have breaking news he did not make it he did not make it but we ll get it done very soon it might not be this year but it could be this year actually we have a chance at getting it even this year which people would be shocked at because they were talking about years years years from now when i took office last month we inherited the consequences of inflation that was more than four times what it was when i left four years ago think of that i left it was at percent and the annual government spending over $ trillion more than projected in alone $ trillion but under the trump administration all of that is changing faster and more dramatically than anyone ever thought possible they didn t think it was possible to do what we ve done in just a very short period of time we ve accomplished more in four weeks than most administrations accomplish in four years on my first day in office i imposed an immediate federal hiring freeze a federal regulation freeze and a foreign aid freeze i signed an order creating the department of government efficiency and put a man named elon musk in charge thank you elon for doing it applause thank you very much and he s doing a great job i wish you could have seen him last night it s really you know he s a very committed person he s a very serious person and he s a very high iq people you know i like high iq people not all have to be but you know it d be nice to have some people up there that laughter he s a seriously high iq individual now he s got his faults also i will tell you that laughter but not too many of them which is now really waging war on government waste fraud and abuse and they re curbing inflation and saving taxpayers billions and billions of dollars every single day and there s even under consideration a new concept where we give percent of the doge savings to american citizens and percent goes to paying down debt because the numbers are incredible elon so many billions of dollars it s billions hundreds of billions and we re thinking about giving percent back to the american citizens and percent down to pay back debt and pay down debt which is if you look at value if it were a real estate balance sheet the debt is tiny but we still we still want to pay it down doesn t matter we don t look at it as a piece of real estate it s america we re going to get it down through intelligence hard work and as elon said a word called caring you have to have you have to care by doing this americans will tell us where there is waste they ll be reporting it themselves they participate in the process of saving money so many of the men and women in this room as an example they pay tremendous amounts of taxes and here are just a few examples of where your money was going before i came along these are just some of the just taken at random oh there are much worse examples than this i was just looking at them before the speech and i can tell you there were much worse and there are some that are horrible but i don t want to really say them because they re very very embarrassing to people very very embarrassing and they re really something but you ll be seeing it and you will be reading about it but just some taking at random $ million for sex change operations in guatemala $ million for sesame street performances in iraq twenty million that s a lot of money laughter you know i know what it costs to do those things you get a cast over for $ give them a couple of bucks tip that s it not $ million laughter twenty million that s gone with the wind on steroids laughter $ million for diversity equity and inclusion contracts at the department of education wow and we ve also canceled we ve canceled all of these saved all of this money and again this is just a small sample this could go on i could read them all day $ million for a consultant i want to know who is that consultant laughter to do esg that s environmental social and governance investments in africa $ million to promote biodiversity conservation and licit livelihoods by developing socially responsible behavior in colombia $ million to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants nobody knows what that even means none of this stuff nobody laughter everyone is trying to figure out what the hell does it all mean $ million for social and behavior changes in uganda forty million is a lot of newspaper ads in uganda laughter $ million for research of evidence based solutions for development challenges $ million for mozambique medical male circumcision laughter what does that what does that mean $ million dollars for strengthening independent voices in cambodia laughter $ million for improving public procurement in serbia $ million to the consortium for elections and political process strengthening including $ million for inclusion inclusive and participatory political process in moldova and $ million for voter turnout in india what do we need to spend $ million for voter turnout in india wow $ million i guess they were trying to get somebody else elected wow we ought to tell the indian government because when we hear that russia spent about two dollars in our country it was a big deal right laughter they took they took some internet ads for $ this is a total breakthrough twenty one million dollars for india elections $ million to strengthen the political landscape in bangladesh conversion $ million for voter confidence in liberia we need voter confidence too when you read this list laughter $ million for social cohesion in mali $ million for inclusive democracies in south africa $ million for improving learning outcomes in asia asia is doing very well we don t need to give them money laughter and in another program $ million plus another $ million for condoms for hamas you know about that laughter a hundred million dollars for condoms condoms does everybody know what a condom is laughter for hamas $ million incenduary we re also finding tremendous abuse waste and fraud in social security social security is what s happening there is going to be one of the great potential scandals in history on the program there are over million social security numbers from people from years old to think of that now over there aren t a lot of people that make it hopefully most of the people in this room will make it but historically you don t have thousands and thousands of people but listen to this million people are on social security rolls from the age of years old to do you think there are really that many laughter those people are seriously old laughter but it gets worse million million people are on social security from the age of years old to years old million people are on the age of social security from years old to years old now the all time record i heard is a woman who was a hundred she was years old that s the record a woman from a certain country where they have actually people that live pretty long actually and she was years old that s pretty old but we re topping her by millions millions of people laughter million people from the age to years old million people are on social security from the age to and over people are on social security over the age of years old okay including people think of it over people between the ages of to laughter and one person between the age of to and the record topper there is one person on social security who is years old laughter which is approximately years older than our country laughter and applause na i said to elon who are these people that are doing this the doge people i said who are they where do they come from he said well number one they love our country and number two they re really genius at computers so nobody is going to fool them when they go in they see some bureaucrat that s scamming the country and they try and talk about you know certain computer language these people say no it doesn t work that way these are people that are have a natural ability as as you know brilliant computer people it was very interesting when he told me that i said that s what you need today but all of these scams have now been terminated in addition over the past month we have effectively eliminated the u s agency for international development which was funding much of this lunacy we virtually shut down the out of control cfpb escorting radical left bureaucrats out of the building and locking the doors behind them what they were doing was so terrible where they were spending the money was so terrible what we haven t looked at yet but will be is does the money come back to them because nobody can be stupid like that and they re not stupid they re smart actually and you know why are doing that does money come back to them so we ll figure that out pretty easily i think and quickly but i ve ended all of the so called diversity equity and inclusion programs across the entire federal government and private sector and notified every single government dei officer that their jobs have been deleted they re all deleted and it s interesting even these country these companies that have tremendous the amounts of money a number of them just announced walmart if you can believe it they just announced that they re stopping and you know these companies are writing off like $ million how can you spend that much money no matter what you re doing if you re teaching something you re going to have an instructor you re going to talk you re going to give them a book please read the book you know and then you find they spent $ million on that what s going on and we were going in the wrong way and our military was really although i tell you you know we we defeated isis with our military in three weeks general razin caine was he s some general he s a real general not a television general and three weeks isis and i i asked him and i saw some of his people that were so great the soldiers we have the greatest military in the world but we don t have the greatest top top leadership that s why afghanistan was such a horrible situation and so embarrassing and so many other things but when we want to with proper leadership there s nobody even close to us we have the best equipment in the world we make the best equipment in the world but we have the best military but you know we never fight to win we fight to just keep it going forever and when we fight to win there s nobody that can even come close to us but i was talking to general dan caine and we call him razin caine and i was told it would take about four years to defeat isis and he did it in three weeks i said to him what do you think general how long will it take sir i think we should do it in less than four weeks you re going to have time leftover and he did he did that and we were told by the television generals it would take four years so we did it that s when i went to iraq i flew to iraq and late at night the dark of night all the windows closed all the lights off in the plane in air force one and we flew in and it was pretty amazing i ll tell you we were landing and there were no lights no lights on the plane sir we have to turn off all lights i said you mean we spend $ trillion and we have to fly in on air force one with the lights off and i went up to the pilot and said hello and by the way these guys are like central casting these are the best looking human beings everybody is like perfect laughter the most handsome people the best looking people you ve ever seen with the flattops and the whole thing and i was a little concerned because the lights are off and everything is off and even the lights in where he was were down very dim very very dim with all of the lights on the fancy dashboards of the plane of air force one we re getting a new air force one if they can ever finish the damn thing laughter we re getting two of them actually but we may have to go a different route because it s taking them a long time we re going to get military that s going to start building we re going to get people to start building properly again in our country because they don t build properly applause this was boeing but we re we re up there and i m looking at these people and again cent i say they look like tom cruise but better laughter stronger tougher and i like tom cruise but these are better and i said i said are we okay captain yes sir we re fine but i m looking out i don t see any lights and we re landing and i m you know i m used to that i like to sit with the pilots a lot and i respect the pilots greatly and we re up there and you know we have the computer i call it the computer voice where it goes that s feet your feet above ground so that means you re very low and i m looking out and my eyes are pretty good and i don t see any lights and the computer goes out it sounds like a an intelligent individual it goes we re a thousand feet up that s very it s a story building this is a big big plane and then it goes i say captain clears throat laughter captain we don t see any lights i said is everything yes sir everything is fine sir we ll be landing in three minutes and then it goes like captain are we okay laughter and then it goes and i m saying man there s nothing out there laughter and then he goes boom perfect landing right on this thing there are no lights on the runway there s no n i don t know how the hell they do it but i m sure as hell glad we had somebody that knows how to fly laughter but they didn t want to have any lights because they didn t want the enemy after spending you know years and trillions of dollars we have to land with air force one with no lights on the runway but they were incredible people and then i got out of the plane and i actually asked my people you know i said excuse me i was very brave sitting in that cockpit am i allowed to give myself the congressional medal of honor laughter and applause and they said i don t think so sir i said well i felt i was extremely brave laughter but now here s the problem with saying a story like that when you kid the press will say president donald trump wanted to give himself the congressional medal of honor laughter headlines you know headlines all over the fake news we call it the fake news but we re all wise to them but it was something and then i went down and it was the same thing i m standing on the top and i look down and there s these handsome people everybody is like from a movie set good looking guys i get down the stairs and what s your name my name is caine sir what s your first name they call me razin i say wait a minute your name is razin caine i love you i ve been looking for you for five years you are the grea laughter this is what i want and there was a general next to him there was a colonel there was a drill sergeant a master sergeant they were all like people i could make a movie right now i d have the best looking people ever and they were great and then i went in and sir would you like to rest before the me no i don t want to rest i don t want to rest i ve been resting on the plane other than the last few moments which were quite harrowing laughter and i said i don t want to rest he was thinking about biden in advance you know biden would have gone there he would have rested for days laughter they and then they wouldn t have had a meeting he d just go home laughter no i said i don t want to rest i don t want to rest at all i want to go so we went into this like bunker and we had a lot of very good talented people and that s when i asked him i said you know i m hearing it s going to take a long time no that s not right sir it s not going to take a long time we ll have it done in four weeks i said how can you say four weeks when in washington they said four years he said it s four weeks sir we ll hit them left we ll hit them right we ll hit them up the center we ll hit them underground and overground we ll knock the hell out of them sir and i said why is it that they said so long he said because they wouldn t let us fight and we re very far away they want us to fight for this from this airport we re very very far away sir and they want us to fight here we have many substations out sub airports they call them remote airports where they build them in the sand and we have many of them and i d use them all sir and i would hit them so hard from so many different directions i said well what do you think he said you just let me know and i called him back and i said go ahead and do it are you sure you can do this general he said yes sir and he did it actually in three weeks it was over a hundred percent of people that are really hurting the middle east hurting the world and it was done and we have i m telling you we have the greatest military in the world but you have to use the right people but there s nothing like what they were able to do in that case and in other cases wherever i gave them something it was done incredibly well and very and you know many of the instances because it s been well reported but we ve also required and we ha so we have a country that s a great country it s a strong country but it s a country that s just now gaining its respect back to the levels that it should should have never lost we were being laughed at by the entire world but we re not being laughed at anymore but we ve also required that all federal employees must once again show up to work this is a new phenomenon you know since covid applause show up to work in person like the rest of us so i mean it doesn t work when you don t show up and i see companies now are all going back to it they re all going back it s great i want some of the big business leaders saying we absolutely are going back you you j you can t work at home they re not working they re playing tennis they re playing golf or they have other jobs but they re not working or they re certainly not working hard you could never build a company or a country with that so we have a very strong policy and if they don t show up to work they they get fired and we re trying to make our government smaller but much stronger and we have tremendous bureaucracy but it s happening a lot of people are leaving and in some cases leaving with pretty good offers you know you re paid seven or eight months and go out find a job but some of these people had jobs they were actually working for us but they also had other jobs and those people in theory they have problems i don t know if we re going to do anything about that so we have other things to do but they were working other jobs instead of working for us so they were staying home working but they were working other jobs getting paid a lot of money perhaps we offered deferred resignation buyouts to all federal workers resulting in more than bureaucrats voluntarily surrendering their taxpayer funded jobs a lot of them are leaving because they don t want to be caught having the second job some are leaving because they didn t want to be in government any longer and and some are leaving because they didn t want to show up to work they wanted to work outside of an office and that s never going to work for anybody including companies the companies ought to get smart you watch these companies where they do that they start going bad nobody knows what s wrong with this company well try getting the people back into the office where they can be cohesive and together in less than a single month the department of government efficiency has already saved over this is just a short period of time $ billion and we re just getting started that s nothing compared to the numbers that you re talking about right applause we re ending trillions of dollars in waste and it ll mean much lower inflation lower interest rates lower payments on mortgages credit cards car loans and much higher stock markets i think the stock market is going to be great in other words we will rapidly grow our economy by dramatically shrinking the federal government and we have to do it i m also taking fast action to end the radical left s nation wrecking crusade against oil and natural gas over the past four years the biden administration cut the number of new oil leases and gas leases by percent they slowed new pipeline i mean look at the any one dakota access they wanted that one knocked out the keystone pipeline they wanted that one knocked out they ended the keystone we got the dakota access done but it wasn t easy after they tried to stop it they slowed new oil and gas pipeline construction to virtually a halt they shut down percent of active oil and gas rigs in the united states but they love the wind turbines they go round and round and round and if the wind doesn t blow they got problems they kill all the birds they ruin the sight lines including the oceans the lakes they closed more than power plants all causing energy prices to skyrocket you saw that happen that s what caused the inflation it s pretty easy these policies were so destructive that despite draining nearly percent of u s strategic petroleum reserve meant for emergencies it was meant for emergencies it wasn t meant for getting the price of gasoline down so that you can win an election didn t work for winning the election actually there s so many people that are driving that it s a very small number it just had a very small effect but in the meantime it takes it down it s at now it s at the lo we ll fill it up fast but it s at the lowest level when we made the transition it was at the lowest level in history ever recorded it s the lowest level nobody s ever seen it that way they they put it all out because they thought they could keep gasoline prices down a little bit just go past the election and then after that they didn t care and it didn t work because they didn t get elected i got elected but the price of gasoline still rose over percent and in some cases at some periods it was percent and percent during certain periods of time under the trump administration we have implemented a very different plan you probably heard of it it s called drill baby drill and we re doing a applause the world runs on low cost energy and energy producing nations like us have nothing to apologize for we have more energy than any other nation in the world and we re going to use it and we re going to use it on ai plants i was telling some of the people that came in that you know they re very inter everybody s talking about ai i hope you re right you know i don t know who knows laughter but elon are they right are they right in going all i they are all in for ai but the problem is to do it just in our country you need twice the electricity just to open up and be the top of ai you need twice the electricity that we have right now in the entire country if you take all of the electricity you need more than twice you need twice you need double what we have right now just to fuel this new industry that s growing i was amazed when i heard that number and they all said how can we do this because you know in china and various other places you can probably get it with the shake of a hand but in our country you can t but now you can because we ve declared i m declaring a national emergency in order to get fast approvals and we re going to have if you build a plant you re able to build an electric generating facility right next to your plant so you ll be making your own you won t have to count on utilities you won t have to count on an old grid that could fail could get hit by something bad things or good things but you re not going to have to you re not going to have to worry about grids you re not going to have you ll build your plant and you ll build your your essentially you become a utility in a way you build your own electricity if you want to build extra and put it out and get paid for that you re going to be able to do that you could put it back into the grid but you re going to be able to build with your plant a generating facility and we re going to get you lee zeldin head of the environment head of environmental the environmental group various groups and we ve got them unified now but we re going to get you very fast approvals and they ll be approved so fast your head will spin and we re going to get that whole industry started and we re going to be the head of it we re leading right now we have the greatest brain power we re leading right now and i expect that we re going to be leading by a lot but we re going to get you the energy very very quickly that would be the one thing that everybody was concerned how do we have that much electricity when los angeles has blackouts and brownouts right now and there s a lack of electricity but we re going to get it at levels never seen before i ended the ridiculous green new scam halting tens of billions of dollars of wasteful deficit spending and i withdrew the united states from the unfair one sided paris climate accord and i ended joe biden s insane electric vehicle mandate because it was just insane i repealed the last and by the way if you want to buy an electric car that s great if you want to buy a gasoline driven car or a hybrid it s great whatever the whatever the thing happens to be i heard hydrogen is hot the problem is when it s not you re in deep trouble because when that sucker blows up they don t find the body laughter so that s one that i said you know what let s take a pass on that one they said it s good but when it s bad it s really bad you find the bodies on trees on the side of a tree laughter i said i think we ll pass on that one right we re not going to want that one but you never know maybe someday it ll be good but it doesn t sound like it s off to a good start i repealed the last administration s very destructive natural gas export ban and last week we approved our first new liquefied natural gas export license and we have literally hundreds of people that want to export i recently met with the japanese prime minister ishiba to discuss large increases in american oil and gas exports they want it so badly they said we went to the biden administration and they wouldn t sell it they wouldn t sell it nobody knows why biden didn t know why either they asked him i don t know laughter he wanted they did oh i didn t know that but we re going to sell it and the new project in alaska is going to feed all of asia we re going to take care of all of asia we have so much oil and gas like very few people like very few countries have like really actually no country has i also met with prime minister modi of india who wants to greatly expand india s purchase of american energy and my administration has also launched the most aggressive deregulation program of any nation in history under my executive order for every new regulation added old regulations have to be eliminated applause and you know in our first term which was actually an incredible success we had the greatest economy in history until covid and even after that we did great the stock market was higher if you think of it it was higher after the fact after we went through that whole thing it was higher than it was just prior to covid coming in which is a pretty amazing thing but we did a great job on that but it was a terrible thing for the world the whole world suffered it suffered terribly including china including other countries it just was a terrible period of time but despite that we did well but we had the greatest economy in the history of our country and i think this time we re going to do even better we had we were artificially hurt by covid we had to focus on that instead of focusing on but just prior to covid coming in there s never been anything like what we did what we achieved and even after we did very well con and especially considering what all of us had to do with covid some nations were hit so badly it was it was just unbelievable what happened to them as part of our effort i ve signed executive orders to keep the united states at the forefront of artificial intelligence and to end joe biden s war on bitcoin and crypto we ended that war totally that war is over they were very hostile toward them until the very end just because there are so many people on bitcoin and crypto that just before the end the sec came out and they were being very nice i was so nice to people because so many people were being indicted for no reason whatsoever very political group of people that s all they did was they liked indicting people but they were being indicted and many of those indictments were dropped just before the election because they said wait a minute there s million million people using this and they didn t want to have you know all these people being voting against but by the time they did that it was too late we had that vote entirely i think i think anybody would smart that believed in that and there were a lot of people believing it anybody that was smart voted for trump and they pulled the indictments and i see people that were indicted i said i saved your life i saved your life because if they thought that they actually thought that i was doing they said why is trump doing it is he doing it for political reasons i don t do anything for political reasons i do what s right i do i want to be on the forefront of every industry applause so i ll be working with the republican congress to pass the largest tax cuts in american history and that includes obviously applause yeah that includes we have to extend the trump tax cuts which were until now the largest we re going to dramatically cut taxes for families and for workers and for companies including no tax on tips and hopefully no tax on social security and no tax on overtime and that overtime one is a sleeper because i think a lot of people are going to be spurred on to do a lot of extra work when they hear that it s a lot of companies really like it and a lot of people really like it the new trump tax cuts will also include percent expensing for new factory construction in the united states and anything else that you re going to buy with capital if you buy something if you buy something that is going to be good for our country we re going to let you expense it one year expense applause and i did that the first time and everybody was saying can you go back to that now you still get i guess percent or whatever but it you know pares down but we re going to bring that right up to the to the top level i think that had a lot to do with the success that i had during my first term and we ll substantially cut taxes for all domestic producers of oil and gas and just about everything else that they produce in my first term i brought the business tax down from around percent to percent which everybody said was an impossible thing to do i cut it from or it actually with state and city it was much higher than but i got it down to percent and now i m bringing it down to a goal of percent but only if you make your product in america in other words you re going to be at percent but if you make your product in america you re going to go from to if you don t you re going to pay percent which is still lower than anything applause so guys like elon are going to come and make his great cars in the united states there a lot of a lot of people will a lot of people are calling a lot of car companies are calling they called me three of them three of the majors they called and they said we re looking all over the place we want to be there i m going to be announcing tariffs on cars and semiconductors and chips and pharmaceuticals drugs and pharmaceuticals and lumber probably and some other things over the next month or sooner and it s going to have a big impact on america we re bringing our businesses back if they don t make their product in america then they very simply they have to pay a tariff but if they do make their product in america they ha they don t have to pay any tariff which will bring it s all going to bring trillions of dollars into our treasury or it s going to mean that there won t be any taxes because we won t have a fair base if they don t have it we don t have it if they don t pay if they don t charge us we don t charge them it s pretty simple the republican party is once again the party of common sense we re a party of common sense we want strong borders we don t want men playing in women s sports we don t want to have transgender for everybody we re the party of common sense that s how we won the election in such a big manner we ll no longer allow other countries to ransack and plunder our nation that s why i ve announced that we will soon begin imposing reciprocal tariffs on any country that engages in unfair and unequal trading practices if they tariff us as i said we will tariff them at the exact same rate so if a certain country because some of these countries even countries that i ve already mentioned are extremely aggressive with tariffs nobody knows that the european union they have a vat tax that s devastating it s very tough for people on the outside hard to sell cars really impossible to sell them because they also have nonmonetary tariffs that are very very tough but if you take a look at that it s a very unfair situation and the vat tax is similar to the tariff around the world i m moving quickly to end wars settle conflicts and restore the planet to peace i want peace and i don t want to see these everybody being killed and you take a look at the death in the middle east and the death that s taking place between russia and ukraine that s been going on and we re going to end it there s no profit for anyone in having world war iii and you re not so far away from it i ll tell you right now you re not so far away if we would have had this administration for another year you would have been in world war iii and now it s not going to happen na and we ve secured a ceasefire in gaza and we re bringing in the hostages and we re bringing them home to their families some of them are in pretty bad shape i have to tell you to end the horrible war in ukraine i have spoken with president putin and president zelenskyy and our teams began negotiations this week in saudi arabia i want to thank saudi arabia for that that was so great applause yeah and i want to thank in particular i mean we have so many of the people yasir mohammed all the people but but in particular we have to thank crown prince mohammed bin salman for hosting these historic talks applause and talks that went very very well steve was there steve witkoff was there and michael was there michael waltz and others and they really went well it s a big it s a big step we ve got to get that war over with you have to see the people that are dying i look at the pictures the the satellite pictures of the field it s a level field and it looks like a modern day version of gettysburg and you know what that means it is just carnage it s horrible and you know it s not american soldiers it s not even soldiers from the middle east in the case of ukraine russia but it s people it s young people from russia and ukraine mostly that are just being decimated it s flat fields and a bullet goes and a bullet only stops when it hits somebody and the level of people being killed in that battle soldiers young soldiers in some cases old soldiers because they re running out of people they re running out of soldiers one case a modestly successful comedian president zelenskyy talked the united states of america into spending $ billion to go into a war that basically couldn t be won that never had to start and never would have started if i was president not even a chance and it didn t start for four years never would have started but a war that he without the u s and trump will never be able to settle they ll never settle that war without our involvement that s why they did such a great job this weekend that s why saudi arabia did such a great job this weekend in hosting the united states has spent $ billion more than europe and europe s money is guaranteed they get their money back it s a form of a loan nobody knows that i know that i said why isn t somebody saying you know we do it the same way and we spent much more money we have to equalize but while the united states gets nothing back so they get their money back it s a loan we just give our money and we had a deal based on rare earth and things but they broke that deal but we they broke it two days ago we had a deal because i said we re spending $ billion and europe gets their money back in the form of a loan and we don t we re just giving the money hand over fist that s the biden administration for you but they re no longer dealing with the same united states as they were dealing with a few months ago why didn t crooked joe biden demand equalization and that this war is far more important to europe than it is to us and that there s a very big beautiful ocean as separation this is you know we re helping europe we re trying to help europe on top of this zelenskyy admits that half of the money that we sent them is missing they don t know where the money is he said well we don t know where half of it is that s great wonderful laughter he refuses to have elections he s low in the real ukrainian polls i mean how can you be high with every city is being demolished it s hard to be high somebody said oh no his polls are good give me a break laughter every city is being demolished they look like a demolition site every single one of them and the only thing he was really good at was playing joe biden like a fiddle he played him like a fiddle that s an expression we use yasir to say that he s pretty easy pretty easy laughter a dictator without elections zelenskyy better move fast or he s not going to have a country left got to move got to move fast because that war is going in the wrong direction in the meantime we re successfully negotiating an end to the war with russia something all admit that only trump is going to be able to do and the trump administration we re going to be able to do it i think putin even admitted that biden never tried europe has failed to bring peace and zelenskyy probably wants to maybe he wants to keep the gravy train going i don t know what s the problem but he hasn t been able to he s very upset that he wasn t invited he could have come if he wanted to but that he wasn t invited to saudi arabia but he s been working for three years there s never been even meetings or phone calls to stop this war it s a horrible thing i figure russia has lost soldiers i think that ukraine has lost probably and it s a terrible thing you ll see body parts bodies and body parts all over the field all over we see them through very accurately through satellites i love ukraine but zelenskyy has done a terrible job his country is shattered and millions and millions of people have unnecessarily died and you can t bring a war to an end if you don t talk to both sides you got to talk they haven t been talking for three years so we hope to see a ceasefire soon and to reestablish stability in europe and the middle east applause but as i thank you very much and as i ve said before it s my hope that my greatest legacy will be as a peacemaker and a unifier that would be a great legacy applause so in conclusion the golden age of america is upon us and i m inviting everyone here today and every citizen across our land to take part in the most extraordinary period of peace prosperity growth innovation wealth creation and expansion the world has ever seen we re on our way i mean everyone is talking about us three weeks we re in there for a couple of days more than three weeks and everyone is talking about it you have to see the crowds of people outside it s pretty amazing what s happening we re on the verge of soaring markets surging incomes booming production groundbreaking technologies thrilling discoveries and a quantum leap in the quality of life absolutely a quantum leap one day very soon our country will have the greatest economy in the history of the world because we once again have a president who puts america first and we put america first and your country should put your country first but in the end we want america first and when it s all beautiful which it s going to be pretty soon we want to help other countries and you want to help other countries but you know i tell your leaders and some of the leaders are in this room right now you got to put your country first whether it s saudi arabia whether it s something else you re going to put your country first but we re going to have plenty left over to help others also as long as you invest in america build in america and hire in america that means that i m fighting for you i am fighting very hard for you together we re going to make the united states of america bigger better bolder richer and greater than ever before it s going to be stronger than ever before we re going to be a peacemaker and a peacekeeper we re going to stop people from these stupid never ending wars we re not going to partake in them ourselves but we ll be stronger and more powerful than anybody by far and if it ever came to war there is nobody that will be able to come close to us but we don t think that s going to ever happen so i want to thank you all very much it s a great honor to be here and i think somebody said they re going to ask questions and i didn t say gee what are the questions like biden does i say just ask it doesn t matter you ask a question and i give an answer so i think richard you re going to come up and you re going to give me some questions thank you very much applause mr attias thank you thank you very much mr president please a round of applause for the president of united states of america thank you applause the president thank you mr attias mr president thank you for accepting to take a few questions twenty years ago i don t know if you will remember we were under the same roof in orlando and you were delivering an amazing speech in front of sales rep giving them the best advice to be successful so what is the best piece of advice that you have ever received the president well i think it was watching my father you know my father was a very hard worker and he just worked hard and he was very smart he had good genetics his brother was the longest serving professor in the history of mit dr john trump and my father was every bit as smart but my father was had to work he was older and he put his brother through school in fact he once said boy i put him through so much school he had three different degrees and they asked him to stay on at mit but my father was the same ilk and i noticed that my father was a happy man and what he did is he worked he just worked all the time he worked worked worked and he loved it and really i think the best piece of advice i got from that is you have to love what you do and if you love what you do you re going to have a happy life if you don t i mean i see so many people they re in businesses that they don t want to be in they re in businesses that you know they re bored in or they re not good at they don t have a natural ability at it there is such a thing as natural ability whether it s sports or acting or anything else i mean some people have an ability for something try and find that ability but you have to love what you do if you love what you do you re going to be at least you have a good chance of being successful mr attias mr president it s almost time for applause for an early dinner so if you are throwing a dinner party and you can invite three fascinating guests living or dead who would you bring the president well they re all sitting right in the front row laughter and applause yasir are you ready mohammed are you ready steve witkoff and we have mr the most important person at least until the world cup is over is here gianni stand up he gave the united states the world cup applause gianni thank you very mu i didn t know you were here that s very good he s the king of soccer that s not bad and you ve done a fantastic job you know but it s very interesting when i was president i got the world cup and i got all of the you know we have the anniversary so that fell in this administration that s a big deal years but we have all of these things happening and i also got the olympics and i was called by the mayor of los angeles sir would you call up the olympic committee because it was at that time president obama will not take their phone call and we re going to get the olympics in los angeles and by the way they ve recommitted to los angeles at a level that you know i was very worried about that and they ve the opposite you know somebody could have said well we re going to do it someplace else until they have actually recommitted they re going to make it bigger and better than ever so i want to let you know that applause but i got i had the olympics so i got the olympics i got the world cup and i said and the but that one i didn t get but it was there it was in this term and i ran an election and we did fantastic in we did much better millions and millions tens of millions but millions and millions of votes better and bad things happened and i didn t get that one and i said you know when i originally signed the olympics i said i won t be able to even be president and i got the olympics because if i didn t when i spoke with the people the organizing committee and the people in different parts of the world they asked me to do it because the president wouldn t do it i was president elect and i gave them a talk i couldn t get them off the phone they were starving for love and the bottom line they gave us the olympics and i said you know isn t it sad i won t be president then we had the election result and now i m president for the olympics and for the world cup applause so i m very happy about that gianni thank you very much thank you g laughs i ll be there i promise i ll be there mr attias and by the way mr president backstage you have a gift from gianni he gave us the first ball with your name the president ooh mr attias which will be played for the cup world cup in america the president that s great it s going to be great thank you gianni very much applause mr attias i doubt that any day you will take a sabbatical year but if you could take a sabbatical year mr president what unconventional thing would you do the president what was the word mr attias sabbatical you don t work for one year the president oh sabbatical i thought thought you said sabbath laughter that s a big difference it s almost the opposite when you think about it right laughter i think what i d do is look what i m doing now is the most exciting job in the world it s a hard job not an easy job it s a nasty job it could be a lot easier with you know i i think that the the news media has to straighten themselves out because people are getting it you know they they re losing tremendous popularity and they ve lost their prestige and they ve lost their credibility and i think it s a very important thing the news media but i think they have to straighten themselves out because the people are going around them now they have so many different things with like elon with x which was a big a big thing and we have truth which has been fantastic and we have so many other things that you don t really need traditional but i i will tell you that there is just nothing i could do to enjoy my life whether it s that or anything else that you d ask because this is the ultimate i mean i had to make a big decision and it was a very risky decision because if i would have lost my life would have been a much different life it would have been a very nasty life they were going after me at levels that nobody has ever seen before not andrew jackson not abraham lincoln you know the historians say that the president that was treated the worst by far by the media and overall was andrew jackson in fact his wife died of heartbreak they were treated really rough and abraham lincoln was second but he had a civil war you know you can understand that but nobody was treated like me nobody and i will tell you you learn a lot about yourself but there s nothing i d rather do i had to make a decision do i do this because if i lost it would have been very very bad it was dangerous actually very dangerous in so many different ways and i decided to do it and i said i have to win because if i don t when i spoke to a friend of mine the other night he said you know if you lost it would have been very it was actually sean hannity just before we did the interview last night he said boy if you would have lost it would have you would have had a tough life you would have had a very tough life so it was there was a certain amount of courage involved in this decision to run and it s a great honor to win by this much to win all seven swing states the popular vote popular vote doesn t get won that much by republicans for whatever reason i think that s changing because again we re the party of common sense and they re the party of some real bad things and i think they ll change i think they have to change it would be wonderful i m going to be having lunch with some of the democrats next week and it would be wonderful if we could work together i think working together would be great but they have to change you can t get elected on the programs that they want and that s one of that s really what america wants to see so there s nothing i d rather do than what i m doing right now applause mr attias when we started this conference mr president when we started this conference yasir and i his royal highness crown prince told us i want that to be the place where people will come to understand where to invest in terms of geographies and sector so what is the best investment you have made in your personal growth mr president the president well i was involved in real estate from you know most of my life and was you know guys like witkoff will tell you i was really good at it and i was successful at it very successful at it i ve been involved in things prior to being president but during the four years during the last four years you know i followed sort of the trends and i ve made a lot of money with following some of these trends and you know it s again it s something that you do you it s i really believe that some people have instinct i think i ve always had an instinct for making money i make money and i went into show business i had one of the most successful shows on television i wrote books and they were all bestsellers virtually every book a bes was a big bestseller some really big bestsellers and so i don t know it s whatever i do i just want to make it successful it s very important to me there are many ways to make money you can be in many different fields and a lot of them is being in the right country you know if you re in a certain country our country was actually getting very bad a very dangerous place actually bad things were happening but if you re in a certain country you have a chance to do well and no matter how good you are if you were born into the wrong country you re not going to make money now you can do other things you can attain power i guess maybe it s the wrong kind of power but it s power but being in the right country where you have the right incentives and you know entrepreneurship et cetera and america has always been sort of at the top or one of the top but always pretty much at the top but it was losing that it was losing that position and i think losing it rapidly this last administration look i don t want to be i wish i could say i i wouldn t have run if if i thought biden was doing a good job if i thought they were i wouldn t have run because as i said it was very dangerous to run in a lot of ways in fact my ear will show that when you look at it closely my ear i have that throbbing feeling every once in a while but it was dangerous in a lot of different ways but he was so bad that i had no choice but to do it if i thought he was doing a great job i wouldn t have run and i would be very happy i actually wanted him to do a good job i was saying do this do that i m telling them do things they should have done what i said and but i would have been i would have been very happy not to have run and frankly to have seen somebody do a good job but our country was going to hell and i really sort of had to run mr attias if you were a historical ruler would you prefer to rule during war or peace the president well i i d i want to be again a peacemaker and i want to keep us out of war but sometimes to do that you have to have a very strong country you have to have a very strong military and as i said we have a much stronger military than anyone would know we have the best equipment and i bought a lot of it i rebuilt our military in the first four years i rebuilt it we gave a lot of it away to afghanistan to the taliban stupidly but that s a very small amount relative it was billions and billions but it s still a very small amount relatively to what we built but i rebuilt largely rebuilt our military now i m going to have to do it again because so much has been given away so much has been treated so badly and but to keep peace you really have to i have a thing strength through and i mean it you really have it you have strength and you need the strength but it s really peace through strength because without the strength it s going to be very hard to have peace because you re going to be taken over bad things are going to happen so you really want to have peace through strength and that s where i ve done it having strength having power in that sense to protect yourself and your people is a very important thing hopefully you don t have to use that power i will tell you i was dealing with president putin very successfully on denuclearization we were talking about it very seriously and then covid came and lots of things came and we had also talked to china about it now russia and us have the biggest nuclear by far china is not close but they will be close in three or four years or five years they ll be equal but we were going to talk to china and i spoke to president xi about it very successfully i think we were going to denuclearize it we were had to get the smaller nuclear powers of which there are four three maybe but four probably to do something we would have been able to do that but i was having very strong talks with president putin about denuclearization and you know if you re president you get presentations about what we re building what we re having the power of weapons the power of many things besides weapons per se when i saw the power of nuclear weapons and we can never let that happen if that happens the ball game will be the world will be destroyed the power is so enormous you look at hiroshima you look at nagasaki multiply that times times and the world would be destroyed so you want somebody as your president or you want somebody as your leader that understands that we just can t let that happen we can t let other countries get nuclear weapons not only iran iran is a good example and maybe the one that people think about but we can t let that happen the power of weaponry today is so enormous that the world the world would disintegrate so we can t let it happen mr attias mr president if you had to describe united states of america in just three words what would they be the president in three words mr attias three words the president love respect and strength applause that s a tough question that might be my best answer yasir that s that reminds me of high school that one but that may have been the toughest question actually do you think joe biden could have done that i don t think so laughter i don t think so mr attias we re almost at the end mr president but talking about united states of america what is one cultural habit in the uni in the u s business that the rest of the world could learn from what is the best practice that inaudible the president well i think we love our families but i think a lot of the world loves their families you know i was speaking to the head of mexico because i complain constantly about people pouring in now our border is the strongest border we ve ever had we ve gone from the worst border ever in history to the strongest border but i was speaking to the president of mexico a very wonderful woman actually and i said we were talking about drugs you can t let people come through your country and come into the country you know i was not that nice but they understood what i was saying and she said something that really got me she said i said are you a you re not a big drug taking nation and she said no we are not a consumer and i said a consumer what a you know an interesting word we re not a consumer nation we re not a consumer of drugs i said what an interesting and why why is that he said she said well we have very strong family values i said but we do too we do too we have very strong our families are devastated by what s happening with fentanyl and china will not be doing we re going to make a deal with china we re not letting that happen anymore and i had a deal by the way before i left i had a deal with president xi where they were going to give the maximum penalty to anybody making fentanyl and sending it into the united states and their maximum penalty is the death penalty and it would have stopped but when the election turned out to be a rigged election but that s okay when election turned out to be it was an election that shouldn t have happened all the all the things that happened i give you an example we wouldn t have had october th israel attack we wouldn t have had ukraine and russia fighting we wouldn t have had inflation we wouldn t have had all of these things that you know happened but in speaking with her she said about family values i said well you re not really saying anything there because we have great families too we have great family values she said plus we advertise a lot i said ooh you mean you advertise about how bad drugs are yes we do we spend a lot of money on advertising and i said unbelievable that was such a great conversation because we re going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars advertising how bad drugs are so that kids don t use them that they chew up your brain they destroy your teeth your skin your everything applause and i thanked her for that you know i i make so many calls and i never learn anything from anybody i know everything and i never learned anything from anybody laughter and i spoke to this woman as soon as she said it she didn t have to say exactly what i said exactly what a great idea and i think we re going to have a and i saw pieces of it we re going to go in with $ million and then another $ million initially but i saw some of the ads and they are really violent i said you have to make them strong your skin practically comes off after a period of time you lose your hearing you you lose your teeth you lose i mean you it it is terrible and we show this happening to people and i think we re going to you know we we did very well with we had blue ribbon committees headed up by the first lady of the united states and a lot of other people that you know they have no idea the viciousness of these cartels and these people and they re smarts i mean they re very smart tough people making a fortune by the way an absolute fortune but we got it down percent which was a record but percent is not great when you think about it i think we could get it down or or maybe even percent with advertising so she really gave me something i i was going to call her and tell her that she did but now i don t have to call her because she s going to be seeing this right now laughter so to the president of mexico thank you very much i appreciate it but we re going to do a great advertising campaign saying how bad it is how drugs are so bad for you applause mr attias my last question mr president you have mentioned briefly in your speech about the legacy what would you like your legacy to be if you can tell us more about it the president that i came into a country that was great but is in trouble and i made america great again and i got it out of trouble and people respect america now and we were a country of peace and we brought peace to the rest of the world applause mr attias thank you thank you very much mr president applause the president thank you very much everybody thank you applause na

MUSK:  Yeah.  Yeah.  (Inaudible.)     THE PRESIDENT:  And, I mean, they really did a number on me, you know.  And I sued, and they had to pay.  You know, they paid $10 million settlement.     Q    You’re okay with that?         MR. MUSK:  I mean, I left it up to the lawyers and, you know, the team running Twitter.  So, I said, “You guys do what you think is the right — makes sense.”     Q    I think it’s funny.     THE PRESIDENT:  I think —     Q    Because —     THE PRESIDENT:  — it’s a very low — I was looking to get much more money than that.         Q    So, you gave him a discount w- — in the lawsuit?     THE PRESIDENT:  He got — oh, he got a big discount.  I don’t think he even knows about it.     Q    He’s become one of your — if you read and believe the media — he’s become one of your best friends.  He’s working for free for you.  He’s —     MR. MUSK:  Well, I love the president.  I just want to be clear about that.       Q    You don’t care about that?      MR. MUSK:  I — no, I love the pr- — I —     Q    You love the president?      MR. MUSK:  I think — I think President Trump is a good man, and — and he’s, you know — I — I —     THE PRESIDENT:  That’s the way he said that.  You know, there’s something nice about.  (Laughter.)     MR. MUSK:  No, it is.  I, you know —     THE PRESIDENT:  It is.     MR. MUSK:  Because, I mean, the president has been so — so unfairly attacked in the media.  It’s truly outrageous.  And I’ve sp- — at this point, spent a lot of time with the president, and not once have I seen him do something that was mean or cruel or — or wrong.  Not once.      Q    You know, I’ve known him for 30 years.     MR. MUSK:  Yeah.     Q    And I’ve never seen anybody take as much as he’s taken.     MR. MUSK:  Yeah.     Q    And we’ve discussed this.  And I’m like, “How do you deal with it?”     THE PRESIDENT:  Did have a choice?  (Laughs.)  I didn’t have a choice.     Q    Well, you would say that to me.  I’m like, “What — what am I going to do?  Worry about it?”     THE PRESIDENT:  That’s the only thing I can say.     Q    And, you know — and then culminating in two assassination attempts, which resulted in your endorsement.      MR. MUSK:  Well, I was going to do it anyway, but that was —     Q    That was it?     MR. MUSK:  — a precipitating event, yeah.     THE PRESIDENT:  That speeded it up a little bit?     MR. MUSK:  Yeah.  Yeah.     Q    The day of the assassination?      THE PRESIDENT:  Nice.  I didn’t know that.      MR. MUSK:  Yeah, it just — it sped it up, but I was going to do it anyway.     Q    Mr. President, with your indulgence, I’m convinced that people only know a little bit about Elon.  I don’t think they know everything about Elon, because as I studied for and prepared for this interview, I learned a lot about you that I didn’t know.  I think people will think about Tesla.  Democrats are demonizing you and — and trying to make the country hate you.      I just want people to understand you a little bit better, and the person that you’ve gotten to know and have now put a lot of trust in.      THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.     Q    And, you know, just — let’s go over a little bit of your bio, starting —     MR. MUSK:  Ah, okay.     Q    — with PayPal and how you became involved in Tesla and SpaceX and Neuralink —     MR. MUSK:  This — this could take a while.     Q    — and all these —     MR. MUSK:  I mean, you know, I — I think the way you think of me is, like, I’m a technologist and I try to make technologies that improve the world and make life better.     Q    You can show them your shirt.     MR. MUSK:  Yeah, and that’s why, like, my t-shirt says “tech support” — (laughter) — because I’m here to provide the president with — with technology support.      And now, that — that may seem, like, well, is that a silly thing?  But actually, it’s a very important thing, because the president will make these executive orders, which are very sensible and good for the country, but then they don’t get implemented, you know?     So, if you take the — for example, all the funding for the migrant hotels, the president issued an executive order: Hey, we need to stop taking taxpayer money and — and paying for luxury hotels for illegal immigrants —     Q    It’s crazy.     MR. MUSK:  — which makes no sense.  Like, obviously, people do not want their tax dollars going to — to fund high-end hotels for — for illegals.  And yet, they were still doing that, even as late as last week.      And so, you know, we went in there, and we were like, “This is in violation of the presidential executive order.  It needs to stop.”      So — so, what we’re — what we’re doing here is — is — one of the biggest functions of the DOGE team is just making sure that the presidential executive orders are actually carried out.  And this is — I just want to point out, this is a very important thing, because the president is the elected representative of the people, so he’s representing the will of the people.  And if the bureaucracy is fighting the will of the people and preventing the pres- — the president from implementing what the people want, then what we live in is a bureaucracy and not a democracy.
Q    Yeah.  You — you’re both aware — you have to be keenly aware that the media and — and the punditry class — not that — you know, I think you’ve proven they have no power anymore, because they threw everything they had at you, and they didn’t win.  And that was, you know, the New York Times, Washington Post, three networks, every late-night comedy show, two cable channels — they — they just threw — they threw everything — lawfare, weaponization.      THE PRESIDENT:  It’s true.     Q    And now I see they want you two to start — they want a divorce.  They want you two to start hating each other.  And they try — “Oh, President Elon Musk,” for example.  You do know that they’re doing that to you?     THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, I see it all the time.  They tried it, then they stopped.  That wasn’t — they have many different things of hatred.      Actually, Elon called me.  He said, “You know they’re trying to drive us apart.”  I said, “Absolutely.”      You know, they said, “We have breaking news: Donald Trump has ceded control of the presidency to Elon Musk.  President Musk will be attending a Cabinet meeting tonight at 8 o’clock.”  (Laughter.)  And I say — it’s just so obvious.  They’re so bad at it.      I used to think they were good at it.  They’re actually bad at it, because if they were good at it, I’d never be president because I — I think nobody in history has ever gotten more bad publicity than me.      I could do the greatest things; I get 98 percent bad publicity.  I could do — outside of you and a few of your very good friends.  It’s, like, the craziest thing.      But you know what I have learned, Elon?  The people are smart.  They get it.      MR. MUSK.  Yeah.  They do, actually.  Yeah.     THE PRESIDENT:  They get it.  They really see what’s happening.      MR. MUSK:  Yes.     Q    And at the end of this interview, I — what I would like is, I — I want people to know the relationship and know more about you.      What is the relationship, Mr. President?     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I respect him.  I’ve always respected him.  I never knew that he was right on certain things, and I’m usually pretty good at this stuff.  He did Starlink.  He did things that were so advanced and nobody knew what the hell they were.      I can tell you, in North Carolina, they had no communication.  They were wiped out.  Those people were — you know, they had rivers in between — land that never saw water, all of a sudden, there was a river and a vicious — like, rapids.  People were dying all over.  They had no communication.      They said, “Do you know Elon Musk?”   And they didn’t really know I knew him.  I said, “Yeah.”  They said, “Could you get Starlink?”  It’s, like, the first time I ever heard of it.  I said, “What’s Starlink?”  “A communication system that’s unbelievable.”      Q    I have it.     THE PRESIDENT:  And he — yeah.  And he said — I called him, and I said, “Listen, they really need it.”  And he got, like, thousands of units of this communication, and it saved a lot of lives.  He got it immediately.  And you can’t get it.  I mean, you have to wait a long time to get it.  But he got it to him immediately.      And I said, “That’s pretty amazing.”  And I didn’t even know he had it.      We watch the rocket ships, and we watch Tesla.     I think, you know, something that had an effect on me was when I saw the rocket ship come back and get grabbed like you grab a beautiful little baby.  You grab your baby.  It just —     MR. MUSK:  Just hug the rocket.      THE PRESIDENT:  I’d never seen —     MR. MUSK:  Everyone — right.  Everyone needs (inaudible) —     Q    You hug the rocket.  You hug the rocket.     MR. MUSK:  — (inaudible) rockets.      THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  No, but — and he said, “You know, you can’t really have a rocket program if you’re going to dump a billion dollars into the ocean every time you fly.  You have to save it.”  And he saved it.  First time —     Q    That’s ever been done.         THE PRESIDENT:  — I’ve ever seen that done.  Now nobody else can do it.      If you look at the U.S., Russia, or China, they can’t do it, and they won’t be able to do it for a long time.  He has the technology.  So, you learn — I wanted somebody really smart to work with me, in terms of the country — a very important aspect.  Because, I mean, he doesn’t talk about it.  He’s actually a very good businessman.  And when he talks about the executive orders — and this is probably true for all presidents: You write an executive order and you think it’s done, you send it out; it doesn’t get done.  It doesn’t get implemented.  They don’t implement it.      They — maybe they’re from the last administration — and they are, in some cases.  You try and get them out as fast as you can.  But I could — as soon as he said that, I said, “You know, that’s interesting.”  You write a beautiful executive — and you sign it and you assume it’s going to be done, but it’s not.  What he does is he takes it, and with his hundred geniuses — he’s got some very brilliant young people working for him that dress much worse than him, actually —     MR. MUSK:  Yeah, they do.     THE PRESIDENT:  — they dress in just t-shirts.  (Laughter.)  You wouldn’t know they have 180 IQ.     Q    Wait.  Wait.  So, what — he’s — he’s your tech support?     MR. MUSK:  I —     THE PRESIDENT:  No, no.  He is —     MR. MUSK:  I actually virtually am tech support.     THE PRESIDENT:  He’s much more than that.     MR. MUSK:  I actually am tech support, though.  But that’s —     THE PRESIDENT:  But he gets it done.  He’s a leader.  He really is a — he gets it done.  You get a lot of tech people, and you have people, they’re good with tech, but they — he gets it done.      You know, I said, in real estate, you had guys that would draw beautiful renderings of a building, and they’d draw the rendering, it would be great, and you’d say, “Great.  When are you starting?”  But they were never able to get it built.  They couldn’t get the finances.  They couldn’t get the approvals.  It would never get done.  And then you have other guys that are able to get it done.  You know, they could just get it done.      I was in real estate.  Same thing in this.  He gets it done.      So, when he said that — he said, “You know, when you sign these executive orders, a lot of them don’t get done, and maybe the most important ones,” and he would take that executive order that I’d signed, and he would have those people go to whatever agency it was — “When are you doing it?  Get it done.  Get it done.”  And some guy that maybe didn’t want to do it, all of a sudden, he’s signing — he just doesn’t want to bothered.     Q    Does — do a lot of those executive orders have to be codified into law to — do you need the Republican Congress to follow up?     THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, and they will.  A lot of them will be.  Yeah.     Q    They will?     THE PRESIDENT:  Look, in the meantime, we have four years.  The beauty is, we have four years.  That’s why I like doing it right at the beginning.  Because an executive order is great.  I mean, the one problem — it’s both good and bad, because when they did all these executive orders, I’ve canceled most of them.  They were terrible.  I mean, we were going to go radical left, communist, okay?  It was crazy.  Their —     MR. MUSK:  Really crazy.     THE PRESIDENT:  — executive orders were so bad, if they ever got them codified, you’d never be able to break them.  So, the damage that Biden has done to this country — and it’s not even Biden; it’s the people that circled him in the Oval Office, okay? — but the damage they did to this country, in terms of, let’s say, open borders — you know, there’s so many things, but open borders, where millions of people poured into our country, and hundreds of thousands of those people are criminals.  They’re murderers.  They’re drug dealers.  They’re gang members.  They’re people from prisons from all over the world.      And we have a great guy, Tom Homan, and he is doing so incredibly.  You saw the numbers.  They’re down like 96 percent.     Q    Ninety-five percent.     THE PRESIDENT:  He is a phenomenal guy.  And Kristi Noem is doing an unbelievable job.  And he wanted her.  He said, “She’s so tough.”  And I said, “I don’t think of her as that way.  You know, she’s very nice.”  He said, “No, she’s so tough.”  And she is.  I see her with the horses.  She’s riding the horse.  Let’s — (laughter) — she’s great.      But the team we have is — is really unbelievable.      But those executive orders, I sign them, and now they get passed on to him and his group and other people, and they’re all getting done.  We’re getting them done.
Q    Let me go back a little bit to your background, because —     MR. MUSK:  Sure.     Q    — it’s beyond impressive.  You were the chief engineer, for example — you were an early believer in Tesla.  You became the CEO and — and then the chief engineer, which was phenomenal.  SpaceX, same thing, which is unbelievable.      I mean, you were the first company — private company to send astronauts successfully into — into space, first private company to send astronauts into orbit.      MR. MUSK:  Yeah.     Q    That’s — that’s pretty deep.      THE PRESIDENT:  He’s going to go into orbit soon.     Q    Okay.     MR. MUSK:  (Laughs.)  Yeah.     THE PRESIDENT:  No, he’s going to go to Mars.  He’s going to fly on his —     Q    Starlink.     MR. MUSK:  At some point, yeah.     Q    As in (inaudible) —     MR. MUSK:  But they say — they always ask me, like, “Do you want to die on Mars?”  And I say, “Well, yes, but not on impact.”  (Laughter.)     Q    Star- — Starlink is in 100 countries.      This is going to be hard.  I feel like I’m interviewing two brothers here.     MR. MUSK:  You go ahead.      Q    Starshield, which could be used for national defense.      MR. MUSK:  Yeah, it is already being used for national defense.      Q    Then you have a — what is it called?  Optimus, a part of Tesla.     MR. MUSK:  They’re a robot, yeah.     Q    A robotic arm.  Then you have an AI arm.  And then you have something that really fascinated me, and it’s called Neuralink.      MR. MUSK:  Yes.     Q    You might help the blind to see and people with spinal cord injuries that they — that they can recover, where in the past — how close is that to becoming a success?     MR. MUSK:  At Neuralink we’re — we’ve ha- — we’ve implanted Neuralink in three patients so far, who are quadriplegics, and it allows them to directly control their phone and computer just using their mind, just by thinking.  It’s like — so, we call this product Telepathy, so you control your computer and phone just by thinking, and it’s possible to actually control the computer and phone faster than someone who has working hands.     Then the next step would be to add a second Neuralink implant past the point where these — the neurons are damaged, so that somebody can walk again and so the pe- — they can have full-body functionality restored.  And —     THE PRESIDENT:  And you like Bobby, right?     MR. MUSK:  I like Bobby, actually.  Yeah.  I — I supported Bobby Kennedy.  I think he — you know, he’s unfairly maligned as someone who is anti-science.  But I think he — he isn’t.  He just wants to question the science, which is the essence of the science — the scientific method, fundamentally, is about always questioning the science.      Q    Well, they didn’t tell us the truth about COVID.     MR. MUSK:  Correct.     Q    That’s for sure.      MR. MUSK:  Yes.      Q    And we learned a lot with the Twitter files.  And that just, then, raises a question.  You’re the richest man in the world.  You may not like that part.      THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.     Q    You’re pretty competitive.     MR. MUSK:  I mean, it’s neither here nor there.     Q    I’ve known you a long time.     MR. MUSK:  I don’t think it matters.     Q    But —     THE PRESIDENT:  That’s why I became president.     Q    — he’s on your team.     THE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible) —     Q    Well, that’s true.  He can’t top that.
THE PRESIDENT:  He’s good.  You know, I wanted to find somebody smarter than him.  I searched all over.  I just couldn’t do it.  I couldn’t.  I couldn’t.         Q    You really tried hard.     THE PRESIDENT:  I couldn’t find anyone smarter, right?  So, we had to — we had to, for the country.     Q    But this is the thing —     THE PRESIDENT:  So, we settled on — we settled on this guy.     MR. MUSK:  Well, thanks for having me.     THE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  Yeah.     Q    So —     MR. MUSK:  I’m just trying to be useful here.     Q    But this is the interesting — but this is where we are as a so- — a society.  And I — I hate to do this to you, but I’m going to do it anyway.  You’re doing all of these things.  At DOGE, nobody at DOGE gets paid a penny, correct?     MR. MUSK:  Well, actually, some people are federal employees, so they do.      Q    Oh, okay.     MR. MUSK:  Yeah.  They’re (inaudible).  But it’s fair to say that the software engineers at DOGE could be earning millions of dollars a year and instead of earning a small fraction of that as federal employees.
Q    Okay.  So, just —     THE PRESIDENT:  And they’re very committed people.      MR. MUSK:  Yes.     Q    So — you’re — you’re committed to helping the blind see, people with spinal cord injuries recover.      MR. MUSK:  Yes.     Q    You’re committed to getting to Mars.  You’re committed to rescue — you’re going to help rescue, next month, two astronauts that I think were abandoned.  They — they dispute that in an interview.     THE PRESIDENT:  When are you — when are you getting them?     MR. MUSK:  At the — at the president’s request, we — or instruction, we are accelerating the return of the astronauts, which was postponed, kind of, to a ridiculous degree.
THE PRESIDENT:  They got left in space.      Q    They’ve been there.  They were supposed to be there eight days.  They’re there almost 300.     THE PRESIDENT:  Biden.      MR. MUSK:  They were put —     Q    Yeah.     MR. MUSK:  Yes, they were left up there for political reasons, which is not good.      Q    Okay, it’s not good.  Now, if I had the weight and pressure of doing that successfully on my shoulders, I think I’d be, you know — but you — when we spoke before we did this interview, you were very confident.  You think this will be a successful mission.      MR. MUSK:  Well, we don’t want to be complacent, but we have brought astronauts back from the space station many times before, and always with success.  So, as long as we’re not complacent —     THE PRESIDENT:  When are they — when are you going to launch?     MR. MUSK:  I think it’s about — about four weeks to
bring them back.      Q    About four weeks?      MR. MUSK:  Yeah.      THE PRESIDENT:  And you have the go-ahead.     MR. MUSK:  We’re being extremely cautious.
Q    Yeah.     THE PRESIDENT:  You now have the go-ahead.     MR. MUSK:  Yes.  Well, thanks to you —     THE PRESIDENT:  They didn’t have the go-ahead with Biden.      Q    What’s that?     THE PRESIDENT:  He was going to leave him in space.  I think he was going to leave them in space.     Q    Well, it’s like the (inaudible) —     THE PRESIDENT:  He considered it a —     Q    — growing up, lost in space.      THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, he didn’t want the publicity.  Can you believe it?     Q    Unbelievable.  And so —     MR. MUSK:  Yeah.     Q    — I want to echo something that the president said and then ask an overarching question.  So, people in — get hit with Hurricane Helene, they have no communication with the outside world.  You come to the rescue.  You donated that, I believe?     MR. MUSK:  Yes.  Yes.     Q    You donated to the people of —     THE PRESIDENT:  He saved a lot of lives.  In North Carolina, he saved a lot of lives.      Q    And California, after the wildfires?     THE PRESIDENT:  California.  But, I mean, in North Carolina, where they were really in trouble, they had no communication, people were dying.     Q    Nothing.     THE PRESIDENT:  They were dying of starvation.  He saved a lot of lives in North Carolina.
Q    Okay.  Now you’re going to rescue astronauts.  And now — again, you do — you do all of this — I would think liberals would love the fact that you have the biggest electric vehicle company in the world.      MR. MUSK:  Yeah.  I mean, I used to be adored by the left, you know.     Q    Not anymore.     MR. MUSK:  Le- — less so these days.     Q    He killed that, huh?     MR. MUSK:  I mean, less —     THE PRESIDENT:  I really (inaudible) —     MR. MUSK:  Well, I mean, this — this whole sort of, like, you know — it was — they call it, like, “Trump derangement syndrome.”  And I didn’t — you know, you don’t realize how real this is until, like, it’s — you can’t reason with people.      So, like, I was at a friend’s birthday party in L.A., just a birthday dinner, and it was, like, a nice, quiet dinner, and everything was — everyone was behaving normally.  And then I happened to mention — this was before the election, like a month or two before — I happened to mention the president’s name, and it was like they got shot with a dart in the jugular that contained, like, the methamphetamine and rabies.  Okay?  (Laughter.)     And they’re like, “Whyy?”  And I’m, like, “What is wrong — like, guys, like” — you just can’t have, like, a normal conversation.  And it’s like — it’s like they become completely irrational.      Q    He — he has no idea, if you’re friends with him —     MR. MUSK:  Yeah.     Q    — you pay a price.  You know, it’s like, I walk into a restaurant in New York, and it’s like half the room gets daggers and they want to —     MR. MUSK:  The eye-daggers — eye-daggers level is insane.  (Laughter.)     I mean, there was, like — I had, like, some — some invitation because — so, I got invited to, like, so- — basically, a big, sort of, damn — damn event like that was — but I’d received the invitation, like, the beginning of last year and then — and I still attended, even after I’d endorsed President Trump, and I didn’t realize how profoundly that would affect, you know, how I was received.  (Laughter.)     I mean, I walk into the room and I’m getting just the dirty looks from — from everyone.  Like, if looks could kill, I would have been dead several times over.     Q    But that was not — (laughter) — before Trump     MR. MUSK:  (Inaudible) —     Q    Before Trump: “BC” —     MR. MUSK:  — ashes on the floor.  (Laughs.)     Q    — or “BT.”  Before Trump, that never happened.  Right?     MR. MUSK:  No.     Q    No.  So —
MR. MUSK:  I — I just — doesn’t seem strange?  Like, what — what is up with this total, like, madness?     Q    You’re smarter than me.  Can you — I actually think that there’s a level of irrationality.  It’s almost like a trigger and —     MR. MUSK:  It totally triggers.      Q    And it’s like — look, I — I’ve been on TV — this is my 29th year.  I’ve been on radio 35 years.  I will — I’ve gone hard in the paint to — for candidates that lost.     MR. MUSK:  Yeah.     Q    And guess what?  I get over it.     MR. MUSK.  Sure.  Yeah, yeah.     Q    And I just keep doing my show, and I just — you know, I come back to fight another day.     So, here’s the big — then this is the million dollar or billion dollar — I’m among billionaires — question.  So, you have all this going on and you stop, in a way — you’re still doing it — and you partner with him.  And this is what you get for it from the Democrats.  You get “nobody voted for Elon.”  Well, nobody voted for any of your Cabinet nominees.  Okay?  “People are dying because of DOGE cuts.”  I’ll give you a chance to respond to all that.  “What DOGE is doing is illegal.”  “Elon Musk is” — more street vernacular for a male body part.  “It’s a constitutional crisis.”     MR. MUSK:  How c- — why — why are they reacting like this?     Q    Well, first of all, do you give a flying rip?  Number one.  And —     MR. MUSK:  Well, I guess we must be — if we’re the target, we’re doing something right.  You know, if — like, they wouldn’t be complaining so much if they — we weren’t doing something useful, I think.      What — all we’re really trying to do here is restore the will of the people through the president.  And — and what we’re finding is there’s an unelected bureaucracy.  Speaking of unelected, there’s a — there’s a vast federal bureaucracy that is implacably opposed to the — the president and the Cabinet.      And you look at, say, D.C. voting.  It’s 92 percent Kamala.  Okay, so we’re in 92 percent Kamala.  That’s a lot.      Q    Yeah.  They don’t like me here either.      MR. MUSK:  I think about that number a lot.  I’m like, 92 percent.  That’s, basically, almost everyone.  And so — but if — but how can you — if — if the will of the president is not implemented, and the president is representative of the people, that means the will of the people is not being implemented, and that means we don’t live in a democracy, we live in a bureaucracy.      And so, I think what we’re seeing here is the — sort of, the thrashing of the bureaucracy as we try to restore democracy and the will of the people.     Q    You —     MR. MUSK:  Is this making sense?  I mean — sorry.     Q    Y- — no, of course it does.  I mean, to me, if you look at our framers and our founders — and you’ve really become a student of history, Mr. President, and we’ve ta- — we’ve had conversations both on air and off air — and if we talk about constitutional order or transformational change, nobody can argue that what’s happening here is going at the speed of light.      But however, what were the principles of our framers and our founders?  They wanted limited government, greater freedom for the people — and we’ll get to the specific cutting of waste, fraud, and abuse.  That — that is your goal, is it not?
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  And my goal was to get great people.  And when you look at what this man has done, I mean, it was something — I knew him a little bit through the White House. Originally, I’d see him around a little bit.  I didn’t know him before that, and I respected what he did.  And he fought hard.  You know, he was a — he was maybe questioned for a while.  He was having some difficulties.  It was not easy doing what he did.
I mean, how many people have started a car company and made it really successful and made a better car where it’s, you know, beating these big companies that that’s all they do is cars?  I mean, it’s really amazing the things that he’s done.
But I didn’t know it as much then as now.  I mean, the fruits have sort of taken hold.
But I wanted great people, and he’s a great person.  He’s an amazing person.  He’s also a caring person.  You know, he uses the word “care.”
So, they sign a contract in a government agency, and it has three months.  And the guy leaves that signed the contract, and nobody else is there, and they pay the contract for 10 years.
So, the guy is getting checks for years and years and years, and he’s telling his family, obviously — maybe it was crooked, maybe he paid to get the contract, or maybe he paid that they didn’t terminate him.  But, you know, we have contracts that go forever, and they’ve been going for years, and they’re supposed to end in three months or five months or two years or something, and they go forever.  So, the guy is either crooked — you know, where he knew this was going to happen — or he’s crooked because he’s getting payments that he knows he shouldn’t be getting.
MR. MUSK:  Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT:  But they’re finding things like that.  They’re finding things far worse than that.  And they’re finding billions — and it will be hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of fraud.  I say waste and abuse, but fraud, waste, and abuse.  And he’s doing an amazing job.
And he attracts a young, very smart type of person.  I call them high-IQ individuals, and they are.  They’re very high Q and — high IQ.  And when they go in to see the people and talk to these people — you know, the people think they’re going to pull it over.  They don’t.  These guys are smart, and they love the country.  You know, there’s a certain something.      But he uses the word “care.”  So, people have to care.  Like, when I bought Air Force One —
MR. MUSK:  Exactly.
THE PRESIDENT:  — I negotiated the price.  It was $5.7 billion, and I got it — I got them down $1.7 billion.  Now they’re not building the plane fast enough.  I mean, they’re actually in default — Boeing.  They’re supposed to —
Q    When is it —
THE PRESIDENT:  They’ve been building this thing forever.  I don’t know —
Q    This is the new Air Force One?
THE PRESIDENT:  — what’s going on.
MR. MUSK:  Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT:  We don’t build the way we used to build.  You know, we used to build like a ship a day, and now to build a ship is, like, a big deal, and we’re going to get this country back on track.  We could do it, but so many things — it takes so long to get things built and get things done.
And a lot of it could be something we’ve been discussing.  The regulators go in and they make it impossible to build.  They make it very difficult to build anything, whether it’s a ship, a plane, or a building or anything.  And some of them do it because they want to show how important they are.  Some of them do it maybe because they think they’re right.  They use the environment to stop progress and to stop things.  It’s always the environment.  “It’s an environmental problem.”  It’s not an environmental problem at all.  But they do a lot of things.
And, by the way, speaking of that, Lee Zeldin is going to be fantastic in the position.  So important.  He could take 10 years to approve or disapprove something, or he could do it in a month.  You know, just as good.
Q    Sure.
THE PRESIDENT:  And I think you’re going to see some fantastic — a fantastic job done by him.  He’s a tremendous guy.
Q    Newt — you echoed something when I had just met you, and it was very similar to what Newt has been saying, that we’re — he brought this country to the dance.  This is the opportunity to be transformational, and to have, I would argue, a — the most consequential presidency if we — if we’d really dig down and do something that had never been done before, and that is get rid of this bureaucracy.  And I’m going —
MR. MUSK:  Yes.
Q    — to get to specifics.  You say the same thing.  It’s not done yet.
MR. MUSK:  Absolutely.
Q    And what did you mean by that?
MR. MUSK:  Well, I mean the — w- — winning the election is really the opportunity to fix the system.  It is not fixing the system itself.  So, it’s an opportunity to fix the system and to restore the power of democracy.
And, you know, people — like, it’s funny how — how often it — you — when these attacks occur, the thing that they’re accusing the administration of is what they are guilty of.  They’re saying that things are — are being done are unconstitutional, but what they are doing is unconstitutional.  They are guilty of the crime of which they accuse us.
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s always the first thing they do.
MR. MUSK:  Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT:  “He’s in violation of the Constitution.”  They don’t even know what they’re talking — well, they know.
MR. MUSK:  It’s absurd.
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s just a con job.  It’s a big con job.  And they’re so bad for the country, so dangerous and so bad.
And the media is so bad.  When I watch MSNBC, which I don’t watch much, but you have to watch the enemy on occasion, the level of arrogance and — and cheating and — they’re just horrible people.  These are horrible people.
Q    They lie.
THE PRESIDENT:  These are horrible people.
Q    They tell conspiracy theories.
THE PRESIDENT:  They lie, and they start up with the Constitution.  They couldn’t care less about the Constitution.
CNN, likewise.  I mean, I watched them asking questions with, you know, the hatred with the — why — I said, “What are you asking the question with such anger?  You’re asking me a normal question.”  But you see the bias.  The bias is so incredible.  Those two are bad.
PBS is bad.  AP is bad.  CBS is terrible.
I mean, CBS now — they changed an answer in Kamala.  They asked her some questions.  She answered them like, you know, a low-IQ person.  The opposite of him — the absolute opposite.  But she gave a horrible answer.  They took the entire answer out, and they put another answer that she gave 20 minutes later into the — in- — as the answer.
Q    It was part of her word salad.
THE PRESIDENT:  I’ve never even heard of that be- — I thought I heard of it all.
MR. MUSK:  Right.      Q    That wh- — “60 Minutes” once — one — wanted to do an interview with me, and I said, “Live to tape.”
MR. MUSK:  Yeah, exactly.
Q    They said, “No.”  And I said, “No” —
MR. MUSK:  Right.
Q    — “No deal.”
MR. MUSK:  Exactly.  They can- —
Q    Like, this interview will —
THE PRESIDENT:  I’ve never even heard — you know, I’ve seen where they take a sentence off or something and they’ll do — but they —
Q    Sometimes you cut for time o- —
THE PRESIDENT:  No, no.  They took the entire — this long, terrible statement that she made and put another.
Nobody’s ever seen what’s happening.  And, you know, the people that do all this complaining, they’re very dishonest people.
MR. MUSK:  Yeah.      Q    Yeah.  I — I’m going to, just for the sake of saving time —
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.
Q    — because I could spend — and I’ve done this on radio and TV, I — I can spend an hour finding the outrageous amounts of money being spent abroad, like USAID.
MR. MUSK:  Sure.
Q    And I do want to mention a couple, but I’m going to —
MR. MUSK:  Yeah.
Q    — scroll it and —
MR. MUSK:  Well — well, I guess, at a high level, I think it’s what the president mentioned earlier, which is that in order to save taxpayer money, it comes down to two things: competence and caring.  And —
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.
MR. MUSK:  — and when — when president was shown the outrageous bill for the new Air Force One and — and then negotiated it down, if he had — if the president had not applied competence and caring, the price would have been 50 percent higher — literally, 50 percent higher.  The president cared.  The president was competent.  The price was not 50 percent higher as the result.
And so, when you add more competence and caring, you get a better deal for the American people.
THE PRESIDENT:  But we could take — we were talking about this yesterday.  I could take — give me thousands of bills — any — I could pick any one of them, and I could —
MR. MUSK:  Yes, exactly.
THE PRESIDENT:  — take all thousand.  And let’s say it’s a bill for $5,000 — just $5,000, and it’s done by some bureaucrat.  And if he would say, “I’ll give you three.  I don’t want to pay you five.  It’s too high.  I’ll give you three.”  But they don’t do that.  If a guy sends in a bill for $5,000, they pay $5,000.  They expect to be cut.  Everybody expects to be cut.  When you send in a bill, you expect to be cut.  They send in the bill higher, for the most part.  This is true with lawyers, legal fees.  When they send in legal fees, you — I can cut — I wish I had the time, I would save so — but I could cut these bills in half — much better than half.
But you offer people a much lower number because you know they — they actually put fat — I’m not even saying it’s — it’s like a way of business.  They put more on because they expect to be negotiated.  When you send in a bill to the government, there’s nobody to negotiate.
MR. MUSK:  Yes.
THE PRESIDENT:  You send it a bill for $10,000, and they send you a check back for $10,000.  If you would call them and said, “We’ll give you five.”  “No, no, no.  I need more than five.”  “We’ll give you a five.”  “I’m not going to pay any more than five.”  “Make it six.”  “No, I’m not going to make it six.”  And you’ll settle for $5,500.  You’ve just cut the bill almost in half, and it took, like, two minutes.  When did that stop?  But —
Q    (Inaudible) the art of the deal?
THE PRESIDENT:  — that’s caring.  No, it’s not even the art of the deal.  It’s caring.  He uses the word —
MR. MUSK:  It’s — it’s competence and caring.
THE PRESIDENT:  — it’s caring.
Q    Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s — it’s a certain competence, but I think it’s more caring.
MR. MUSK:  I — if you —
THE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible.)
MR. MUSK:  Actually, if you add either ingredient — either competence or caring — you’ll — you’ll get a better outcome.  But it stands to reason —
Q    Right.  People don’t want to do this (inaudible.)
MR. MUSK: — that’s the reason that if you don’t have competency and you don’t have caring, you’re going to get a terrible deal.  And the problem is that the American taxpayer has been — been getting a terrible deal, because — look at the last administration.  Can you — can anyone — can any reasonable person say that last administration was either competent or caring?
Q    But they lied to us and said that Joe didn’t have a cognitive decline.
MR. MUSK:  They fully lied.
Q    They said the borders were closed.  They said that the borders were secure.  They said that —
MR. MUSK:  Right.
Q    You know, they said Obamacare would save —
MR. MUSK:  They flat out lied.
Q    They flat out lied —
MR. MUSK:  It was insane.
Q    — on many occasions.
MR. MUSK:  Yes.
Q    I tell my audience all the time: Don’t trust government.
MR. MUSK:  Yes.
Q    So, the — I want — as I scroll this information, and it’s — it’s — I’ll scroll a lot more than I’ll mention to both of you, and this is the cost savings.  I want you — I want people at home to understand this part: The average American makes $66,000 a year.
MR. MUSK:  Yeah.
Q    Okay?  We have $37 trillion in national debt.
MR. MUSK:  Yes.
Q    Now, all the money I’m about to mention and what we’re going to scroll on our screen — and all of this is going to foreign countries.  It is not being spent here in America —
MR. MUSK:  Yes.
Q    — for better schools, law and order.
MR. MUSK:  I — I think the average taxpaying American should be mad as hell because their tax money is being poorly spent.
Q    I’m mad.  It’s stealing from —
MR. MUSK:  It’s a — it’s an outrage —
Q    — our kids and grandkids.
MR. MUSK:  Yes, and the — and people —
THE PRESIDENT:  And a lot of fraud, Sean.  A lot of fraud.
Q    Yes.
THE PRESIDENT:  And a lot of kickbacks.
They’re sending money out.  They’re not that stupid.  These people aren’t that stupid.  They’re sending for transgender — something having to do with the opera, and they’re sending out $7 million —
MR. MUSK:  (Laughs.)  Literally.
THE PRESIDENT:  — $7 million.  (Inaudible) —
Q    You just stole my next line.  I can’t believe that.
THE PRESIDENT:  No, it’s incredible.
Q    I was going to mention that.
THE PRESIDENT:  No, but it’s incredible: $7 million.
Now, you know they — they’re not so stupid.  They’re sending all this money.  They expect to get a lot of it back.  And that’s what happens.
Q    Okay.  So, let’s go through it.
MR. MUSK:  Yes, they’re — a bunch of —
Q    So, for the average person at home —
MR. MUSK:  — this stuff is round-tripping.  To the president’s point, they’ll — they’ll make it sound like it’s going to help some people in a foreign country, but then they — then they get kickbacks.
Q    All right.  Let me go to the ne- — to the fir- —
MR. MUSK:  Yeah.
Q    — to the second question first.  I want to know, because people like Joni Ernst, and — and House —
MR. MUSK:  Yeah, Joni — Joni Ernst has been —
Q    They tried to get —
MR. MUSK:  — has tried for a long time, and she’s actually got a lot of good data.  Senator Ernst has been really helpful, actually.
Q    Okay, but they — they actually hide what the real purpose of the spending is.
MR. MUSK:  That’s true.
Q    In other words, they — and — and h- — this is a question: How did you decipher?  It will say, “Humanitarian blah, blah, blah in Serbia or Afghanistan.”  We’ve been giving money to China for crying out loud, which I think is nuts.
MR. MUSK:  Well, we’re giving money to the Taliban.
Q    Money to the Taliban?
MR. MUSK:  Like a lot.
Q    All right.  So —
MR. MUSK:  (Laughs.)  I’m like, for what?
Q    But they —
MR. MUSK:  I — I want to see pictures of what they did.
Q    But they try to obscure it, and — and — but then you got to the bottom line, which is what I’m now scrolling on the screen —
MR. MUSK:  Yes.
Q    — and that is: $20 million on a Sesame Street show in Iraq; $56 million to boost tourism in Tunisia and Egypt; $40 million to build schools in Jordan; $11 million to tell the Vietnamese to stop burning trash; $45 million for DEI scholarships in Burma; $520 million for consultant-driven ESG investments in Africa; DEI programs in Serbia; the president’s favorite — I’m sure you — you love that taxpayer money was spent on a DEI musical in Ireland or a chan- — transgender opera in Colombia or a —
MR. MUSK:  If I could, like, it sounds like —
Q    — transgender comic book in Peru.
MR. MUSK:  It sounds like — it sounds like how can these things be real?  But this is actually what was done.
Q    Okay.  The — I —
MR. MUSK:  It — it sounds like a comedy sketch or something.  It’s like —
Q    I have 20 pages of this.
MR. MUSK:  Right.  It’s not — the list is a mile long.
THE PRESIDENT:  The one thing you didn’t mention, the media.  The media is getting millions of dollars.
MR. MUSK:  Yes.
THE PRESIDENT:  Now, they say Politico, which is a radical left —
Q    Subscriptions.
THE PRESIDENT:  — you know, garbage magazine or — or program.  I guess they have magazine and they have some — some media of all types.  $8 million.
I hear the New York Times got a lot.  I hear they get subscriptions — where they have subscriptions but maybe the paper is not sent.  I have no idea if that’s true or not, but it’s — they call it subscriptions.  Lots of subscri- — to different media, not just the Times — maybe the Times, and maybe not the Times.
Q    A million dollars in subscriptions is a lot.
THE PRESIDENT:  Well — but — but millions of dollars going to media that’s radical-left, crooked, dishonest media.
MR. MUSK:  Well — well, Reuters — this is actually really wild: Reuters got like — something like $10 million for something that was literally titled “mass disinformation campaign.”
Q    Well —
MR. MUSK:  That was on the purchase order.  Well, I — I
thought that was a little bold.  (Laughs.)
Q    I will tell you what was bold is when you released —
MR. MUSK:  I’m like —
Q    — the Twitter files.
MR. MUSK:  — shouldn’t you at least try to call it something else?  (Laughs.)
Q    The Twitter files — how they targeted him; how Twitter, at the time, worked closely with the FBI, the CIA; and, even before the release of Hunter’s very real laptop, they were feeding them disinformation.  That —
MR. MUSK:  Absolutely.
Q    — you found all that out.
MR. MUSK:  Well, I think —
Q    That’s called transparency, right?
THE PRESIDENT:  The FBI has to be rehabbed.  The FBI —
MR. MUSK:   Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT:  What’s happened with the FBI and the DOJ is just — their — their stock has gone way down.  I mean, their reputation is shot.
Q    And intelligence.
THE PRESIDENT:  And I think Pam is going to do great.  I think Kash is going to do great.  I think they have to do great or we have a problem.
But when you look at what they did, the raid of Mar-a-Lago — the raid of Mar-a-Lago — you look at what they did, their reputation is shot.
Q    It is.
What — you were going to say, Elon?
MR. MUSK:  Well, no, I was going to say that I think probably a — like, a lot of people still —
Q    How — how did you find (inaudible)?
MR. MUSK:  — still believe, like, the Russia hoax, even though you’ve done a lot to combat that.  The — you know, the — the Steele dossier was an incre- — a massive scam that was concocted by Hillary Clinton and her — her campaign.
Q    She bought and paid it — for it —
MR. MUSK:  Right.
Q    — Russian disinformation.
MR. MUSK:  There was — it was — the — people still think the — the Russia hoax is real.  Like a lot of people s- — because they never — they never heard the counterpoint.  I mean — I mean, a bunch of people should be in prison for that.  That was a — that was outrageous election interference, creating a fake Russia hoax.
Q    How much — if you had to put a number on it, how much do you think you’ve identified waste, fraud, abuse, corruption at this point?  And again, we’ve been — we’re going to be scrolling this throughout the program.
MR. MUSK:  Well, the — the overall goal is to try to get a trillion dollars out of the deficit.  And if we — if we — if the deficit is not brought under control, America will go bankrupt.  This is a very important thing for people to understand.  A country is no different from an individual, in that if an individual overspends, an individual can go bankrupt, and so can a country.
And — and the out- — the massive waste, fraud, and abuse that has been going on, which is leading to a $2-trillion-a-year deficit, that — that’s what the president was handed on Jan. 20th, a $2 trillion deficit.  It’s insane.
Q    For this fiscal year?
THE PRESIDENT:  Two trill- — yeah.  We inherited it.
MR. MUSK:  Two —
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  And inflation is back.  I’m only here for two and a half weeks.
Q    That was January —
THE PRESIDENT:  Inflating is back —
Q    — you were there for a week.
THE PRESIDENT:  No, think of it, inflation is back.  And they said, “Oh, Trump infla-” — I had nothing to do with it.  These people have — have run the country.  They spent money like nobody has ever spent.  They were — they were given $9 trillion to throw out the window — $9 trillion, and they spent it on the Green New Scam, I call it.  It’s the greatest scam in the history of the country.  One of them.  We have a lot of them, I guess.  But one of them.
Q    Well —
THE PRESIDENT:  Dollar-wise, probably —
Q    — and DEI —
THE PRESIDENT:  — it is.
Q    — and wokeism —
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, yeah.
Q    — and transgenderism —
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, that’s all part of it.  Yeah.
Q    — and LGBTQ+.
MR. MUSK:  Yes.
Q    And, by the way, not in America — other countries, not here.
THE PRESIDENT:  You know, the amazing thing is when you see, like, the teaching of DEI: $9 million.  How do you spend $9 million to teach no matter what it is?
MR. MUSK:  Right.
THE PRESIDENT:  You could teach physics.
MR. MUSK:  Exactly.  Totally.
THE PRESIDENT:  You could go to MIT for a lot less.
MR. MUSK:  It’s (inaudible) expensive.  (Laughs.)  Expensive.
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, the teaching —
MR. MUSK:  Expensive BS.
THE PRESIDENT:  — of DEI.
Q    Well, I think it would be better spent on —
THE PRESIDENT:  No, it’s a kickback.  It’s got to be a kickback.  Nobody is that — nobody could do that.  Nobody is —
Q    Well, it —
THE PRESIDENT:  Nobody is giving — to assess the dialog of an audience coming out of a theater: $4 million.
Q    How much do you believe, Elon, you’ve identified in — in waste, fraud, abuse, corruption now?  And how much —
MR. MUSK:  Well —
Q    — do you anticipate you will?
MR. MUSK:  Sure.  Well, the — I — I think —
THE PRESIDENT:  One percent.
MR. MUSK:  (Laughs.)
THE PRESIDENT:  No, because it’s so massive.  It’s — this is —
MR. MUSK:  Yeah, exactly.
THE PRESIDENT:  — huge money.  Huge money.  Look —
Q    So, what we’ve found now is one percent?
MR. MUSK:  Well, we’ve j- — we’ve just gotten started here.
THE PRESIDENT:  As good as they are, they’re not going to find some contract that was crooked — you know, crooked as hell.  And, I mean, there’s going to be so much that isn’t found.  But what is found — I think he’s going to find a trillion dollars.
MR. MUSK:  Yeah, I think so.
THE PRESIDENT:  But I think it’s a very small percentage compared to what it is.  I mean, he could tell you about treasuries; he could tell you about a woman that worked for Biden that became a very wealthy woman while she was working for him.  Right?
MR. MUSK:  Yeah.
Q    Yeah, I know who you’re talking about.
MR. MUSK:  I mean, there are some strange situations where people — where, you know, someone’s working for the government earning $200,000 a year, and then, suddenly, they’re worth tens of millions of dollars within a few years.  Where’d the money come?
Q    How’d they earn it?
MR. MUSK:  Yeah.
Q    They have a private company on the side?
MR. MUSK:  We’re just curious.  Like, can you —
THE PRESIDENT:  While they were working.
MR. MUSK:  Can you show us — because, like, in order to be worth tens of millions of dollars, you’d have to start a company, or you’ve got to get some kind — the compensation has got to come from somewhere.  So, how does a civil servant with — earning $200,000 a year suddenly, within a span of a few years, be worth tens of millions dollars?
Q    W- —
MR. MUSK:  So, I just want to connect the dots here.
Q    All right, s- —
MR. MUSK:  Maybe there’s a legitimate explanation, but I don’t think so.  (Laughter.)
Q    So, you know, and this gets to kind of the heart of where I am.  I — I looked at your work, and I look at this amount of money, and I get angry.  And I don’t get v- — I’m not an angry person.
MR. MUSK:  Sure.
Q    I don’t get angry.  I get a- — I get annoyed sometimes, but I don’t get angry.
And I did live paycheck to bay- — paycheck a part of my life.  And I think of, you know, the working men and women in this country that the — 56 percent of which cannot afford a $1,000 emergency after four years of Harris and Biden.
MR. MUSK:  Sure.
Q    Okay?  That is serious, you know, financial trouble.  Or they’re putting bare necessities on credit cards.
And I’m looking at this and I’m thinking, well, how much — when we — when all is said and done, we could have written a check or cut the taxes or fixed our schools —
MR. MUSK:  Yes.  Yes.
Q    — or deported these illegals that we keep finding, known terrorists, cartel members, gang members.
MR. MUSK:  Yeah.
Q    And — and we’re not doing it.
THE PRESIDENT:  Sean, the saddest thing is they don’t talk about the individual lines.  I could go on your show right now,  I could get a list that I have on the beautiful Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, and it’s got 40 points, and all they are is the heading of what this money is.
You don’t have to go deep into it, and you see it’s, you know, all different things and it’s so ridiculous.
I mean, normally, when you look for fraud, you’re looking for one thing out of a hundred.  Here, out of a hundred, 95 are going to be bad.  I mean, they’re — and they’re so obvious just by the heading.
But they never mention that.  They only mention, “This is a violation of our Constitution.  This is a” — the word they give, you know, it’s like a sound bite — “constitutional crisis.”  It’s a new thing, “constitution-” —  But they never mention about where the money is going.
MR. MUSK:  Yes.  Exactly.
THE PRESIDENT:  And when people hear that — I had a very smart man, John Kennedy — he’s actually a very smart man.  He said, “Sir, you should just go on television and just read the name of the topic that you’re giving all the money — just the topic that you’re giving this money to, and don’t say anything more,” and he’s right.
MR. MUSK:  Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT:  And I’ll do it at some point, you know, when —
But they never talk about where the money is going.  They just talk about, “It’s a constitutional crisis.”
It’s so sad.  And honestly, I think they’re bad people.  I used to give them the benefit of the doubt, but you almost think they hate the country.  I think they hate the country.  They’re sick people.
Q    Remember, what they can’t — what they couldn’t accomplish at the ballot box, what they can’t accomplish legislatively, now they’re using the courts.
MR. MUSK:  Yes.
Q    And they c- — they’re trying to bury you in lawsuits.
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.  You know the good news, though?  They’ve lost their confidence.  They’re not the same people.
Q    I think you’re right.
THE PRESIDENT:  They’re — they’re not the same people.
This election was brutal for them.  We won every swing state.  We won by millions and millions of votes.  We won everything.  We — all 50 states went up — all 50.  It’s never happened.
Q    Popular vote.
THE PRESIDENT:  Every one.  All 50 states went up.
They’ve lost their confidence.  I see it.  And they’re — they’re just swirling and twirling.  They don’t know what the hell is happening.  They’re much different.  They’re just as mean, but they’re not getting to the point.
Q    Why do you invite them into the Oval Office nearly every day?
MR. MUSK:  (Laughs.)
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the media — you’re talking about the media.
Q    Yeah, your friends in the media.
THE PRESIDENT:  The media — no, they’re — you know, the anger that — they ask questions so angry — a question — a normal question.  I give them an answer.  They — but they — I say, “Why are you so angry when you ask a question?”  Just a standard question.  And, I don’t know, there’s something —
Q    They haven’t had a- — they haven’t been allowed in that office for the last four years, and here you’re giving them access.
Let me go to an area that I think is key, and — and you talked about this in recent interviews, and that is: We don’t need a Department of Education.  Okay.  And what some people are trying to do is stoke fears that, “Oh, my gosh, my kid is not going to get the money for education.”
THE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  Yeah.
Q    Or “grandma’s Social Security and Medicare.”  This was a big promise of yours on the campaign trail.
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  Yeah.
Q    So, I really want to give you both an opportunity to assure the American people you will keep — that money will be allocated for students, but with higher standards.  For example, I would assume associated with monies given or vouchers.
THE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible) so much and — and then Elon goes.  But, look, Social Security won’t be touched —
Q    Won’t be touched.
THE PRESIDENT:  — other than if there’s fraud or something — we’re going to find it; it’s going to be strengthened — but won’t be touched.  Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched.  It’s just —
Q    Nothing.  I want you to —
THE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible) don’t have to.
Now, if there are illegal migrants in the system, we’re going to get them out of the system, and all of that fraud.  But it’s not going to be touched.
School — I want to bring school back to the states, so that Iowa, Indiana — all these places — Idaho, New Hampshire — there’s so many places, the states.  I figure 35 really run well.
And right now, it’s Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, China — China, can you imagine? — has top — top schools.  We’re last.
So, they have a list of 40 countries.  We’re number 40.  Usually we’re 38, 39, but last time, we were number 40.  And what I say is you’ve got to give it back.
So, it doesn’t work.
I’ll tell you what we’re number one in: cost per pupil.  We spend more money than any other country by far — it’s not even close — per pupil.  Okay?  So, we know it doesn’t work.
So, we spend the most and we have the worst — right? — the worst result.  When we give that — when we give that back to Indiana, when we give that b- — back to Iowa and back to a lot of the states that run well — they run well, a lot of them — 35, 37, 38 — now, you’re going to have 10 laggards, but you’re going to have 5 real laggards, but that’s going to be okay.
Take New York — you give it to Westchester County, you give it to Suffolk County, you give it to Upstate New York, and you give it to Manhattan — but you give it to four or five subsections.  Same thing in California.  Los Angeles is going to be a problem, but you’re going to give it to places that run well.  We can change education
Now, school choice is important, but that will get care — taken care of automatically.
We want to bring education back to the states.  You will spend half the number.  And I’m not even doing this —
Q    So, you’re leaning more towards grants not vouchers, like to parents?
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m not even — I’m not even doing this to save, but you will save.  It will cost you much less money.  You get a much better education.
If you go to some of these states, you’ll be the equivalent of Norway, Sweden, Denmark — places that really have a good school system.  You’ll have — those places will be the equivalent, and your overall numbers will get so much better.
Q    Do you want standards associated with the money?
THE PRESIDENT:  The only thing I want to do from — from Washington, D.C., is make sure they’re teaching English, reading, writing —
Q    Math and science.
THE PRESIDENT:  — and arithmetic.  Okay?
Q    Science?  Science might help.
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  A little science.  You know —
Q    Computers.
THE PRESIDENT:  — you’re not going to have much of a problem with that, but that’s it.
Do you know, we have half the buildings — I mean, you look at Department of Education —
MR. MUSK:  It’s empty.
THE PRESIDENT:  Look at the real estate and the —
MR. MUSK:  Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT:  — the level.  For what?  To — to — I mean, for — what do they do?
We have really bad educa- — the teachers — I love teachers.  I respect teachers.  And, by the way, there’s no reason why teachers can’t form a union.  They can do whatever they want to do, if it’s back in the states.  So, we’re not looking to hurt the teacher — I’m — I’m going to help the teachers.  I think the teachers should be incentivized, because a good teacher is like a good scientist, is like a great doctor.
MR. MUSK:  Sure.
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s a valuable commodity.
MR. MUSK:  Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT:  I think they should be incentivized.
MR. MUSK:  Yes.
THE PRESIDENT:  So, I’m totally for the teachers.
MR. MUSK:  Absolutely.
Q    I interview a guy a lot on radio.  He’s from Wichita, Kansas.  And he started —
THE PRESIDENT:  Right.
Q    — as a medical doctor.  Started Atlas.MD, and he’s now — he’s rolled it out nationwide.  Concierge care, $50 a month, 24-hour access to a doctor.
THE PRESIDENT:  Right.
Q    You know, they use a lot of telemedicine now as part of it — very innovative.  He negotiates directly with pharmaceutical companies.  People — if they have high blood pressure, they walk out with their medicine.  They have high cholesterol, they walk out with their medicine.  And they pay pennies on the dollar.
You mentioned —
THE PRESIDENT:  By the way, forms of that could be done.
Q    Forms of that?
THE PRESIDENT:  Forms of that could be done.
Q    Innovation.
THE PRESIDENT:  We got hurt when we didn’t get the vote on Obamacare.  I made Obamacare — I had a choice: I could let it rot and win a point, or I could do the best you could do with it.  And that’s what I did.  We did a great job with it, and we made it sort of work, but it’s lousy.  We could do so much better.
And when you say — you go to certain areas, they — they have doctors round the clock.  They have great medical care for a fraction of what we’re paying right now.
There are things we could do.
But, look, just overall, this man has been so valuable.  I hate to see the way they go after him.  They go after him.  It’s so unfair.  He doesn’t need this.  He wants to do this.
First of all, this is bigger than anything he’s ever done.  He’s done great companies and all, but this is much — you know, this is trillion — everything’s trillions, right?
MR. MUSK:  Yeah.  The numbers are crazy.
Q    To go back to my original point —
THE PRESIDENT:  He can save —
MR. MUSK:  Yeah.
Q    But let me — give him his $10 million back.
MR. MUSK:  Well — well — I — no.  So, people ask me, like, “What’s — what’s the — what’s the — what’s, like, the — what’s your biggest surprise in — in D.C.?”  And I’m like, “The sheer scale.”
Q    It’s massive.  So, you love the challenge?
MR. MUSK:  Well, I mean, to —
THE PRESIDENT:  He’ll never do anything bigger.
MR. MUSK:  To the president’s point —
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s the only thing you can say, “He’ll
never do anything” —
MR. MUSK:  But, I mean, you do something slightly better, and you save billions of dollars for the American taxpayer — just slightly better.  Slightly.  (Laughs.)
Q    When you say “tech support” —
MR. MUSK:  You go one percent better, and it’s, like, you know, tens of billions of dollars saved to the American taxpayer.
Now, if I may address the point that you — the question you asked earlier, which is, you know, how do we assure people that —
Q    They want to know.
MR. MUSK:  Yeah, how do we assure people that we’re going to do the right thing, that their — that their Social Security benefits will be there, that their — the medical care will be good and s- — and — in fact, how do we make it — ensure that there’s better medical care in the future?  How do we improve their benefits?  How do we make sure that their Social Security check goes further than it did in the past and not — it doesn’t get weakened by inflation?
So, the — if we — if we address the — the massive deficit spending, the sort of — the — the waste in the government, then — then we can actually address inflation.
So, provided the economy grows faster than the money supply, which means you stop the government overspending and the waste, and the output of real useful goods and services exceeds the increase in the money supply, you have no inflation.
Q    Yeah.
MR. MUSK:  And — and you also drop the — the interest payments that people pay, because if the government keeps —
Q    Way too high.
MR. MUSK:  Yes.  The — the reason the interest payments are so high is because the — the national debt keeps increasing.  So, the — the government is competing for — to sell debt with — for — with — with the private citizens.  This drives up the interest rate.
So, if you have a — if you have a — if you cut back on the deficit, you actually have an amazing situation for people, because you get r- — you get rid of inflation and you drop the interest rates.  And that means people’s mortgage payments go down, their credit card payments go down, their car payments go down, their student loans go down.  Everything — their — their life becomes more affordable and they’re standard of living improves.
Q    How quickly?  Because I think people are suffering now.  We’re still living under the Biden-Harris economy.
THE PRESIDENT:  But, Sean, you have states right now —
Q    Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT:  You have some states that operate that way.  They operate as well as any corporation.  They really operate well.
MR. MUSK:  Yeah.
Q    Florida.
THE PRESIDENT:  They have surpluses.  They ha- — they don’t —
MR. MUSK:  Texas is — has a surplus, for example.
Q    Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT:  When they — when they look at New York and — and California and some of these places that should have an advantage — I mean, there’s a big advantage — or Pritzker does such a bad job in Illinois; it’s horrible how bad he is — and they don’t have that advantage.
You know, New York has stock exchange and a lot of things.  And California has the weather and the beautiful water and all the thing- —
MR. MUSK:  California has — has great weather.  The most expensive weather on Earth.
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  (Laughter.)  But — but —
Q    I like Florida.
MR. MUSK:  Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT:  But some states operate the way he’s talking about.
Q    Efficiently.
THE PRESIDENT:  When you go into some of these states, you’re going to find very little.  You’re going to find almost nothing.  They really operate well — big surpluses, low taxes.  And —
Q    You know, my taxes went up the first time you were president, because you took away the SALT deduction —
THE PRESIDENT:  I — well, I did.
Q    — which, by the way, I thought was the right decision.
THE PRESIDENT:  It was the right decision — in fact, Reagan tried to do it — because it rewards badly run states.
But at the same time, it’s a tough — it was — it’s tough for the states.  I mean, it really is tough for the states.
The sad part is it rewards really badly run states.
Q    Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT:  And Reagan tried to do it.  He was unable to do it.  I got it done.
Q    You got it done, and —
THE PRESIDENT:  And now we’re going to give some back.
Q    A little bit.
THE PRESIDENT:  Because you know what?  We’ve got to help them.
Q    It’s only a little.
THE PRESIDENT:  We’ve got to help.
Q    Because otherwi- — we’re encouraging people to elect high taxes, spen- —
THE PRESIDENT:  Nobody had any idea it would be that devastating.  I did the right thing.  I got something that Reagan couldn’t do.  I got it done, where everybody is — are the same.  But you know what?  We’ve got to help them out.
Q    Reagan had the Grace Commission, some of the best business minds in the country.
THE PRESIDENT:  Right.
Q    And they came up with recommendations.  Congress adopted none of them, and none of them were implemented.
I’ve got to ask this question, because the media is obsessed about it: What — what if there is a conflict?  In other words, because you do business — it was funny, when it came out the other day, that there was going to be, I think, $400 million — billio- — I don’t know if it was millions or billions — a lot of money on Teslas that Joe Biden’s administration w- — did with Tesla, and —
MR. MUSK:  I’m not familiar with that.
Q    You’re not even familiar with it?  But —
MR. MUSK:  I — I don’t think — are you talking about, like, the Inflation Reduction Act stuff or —
Q    It was some — it was a purchase order of Tesla vehicles.
MR. MUSK:  Oh.  Oh, that was — that was incorrect.  There was s- — like, there’s some sort of — the media claim that there was, like, $400 million worth of Cybertrucks —
Q    That was it.
MR. MUSK:  — being bought by the DOD.
Q    And that he gave it to you.
MR. MUSK:  No — well, first of all, that was —
THE PRESIDENT:  No, actually, it was —
MR. MUSK:  Th- — it was fa- —
THE PRESIDENT:  It was Biden.
Q    It was Biden.
THE PRESIDENT:  And you know Biden wouldn’t give him much.
MR. MUSK:  But — but it wasn’t even — it was fake news, six weeks to Sunday.  Tesla is not getting $400 million for Cybertrucks.  And the — and the — and this alleged —
Q    That’s what it was, Cybertrucks.
MR. MUSK:  This — yeah.  This alleged award occurred in December, before the president took office.  So, it’s — it’s fake on multiple levels.  There i- — Tesla isn’t getting $400 million.  And even if it — even if it was, which it isn’t, it was awarded during the Biden administration.
Q    Okay, but you’re — you — you —
MR. MUSK:  It’s total fake news.
Q    There — there is —
MR. MUSK:  It’s fake on, like — it’s like multiple leverals —
Q    There is some integration —
MR. MUSK:  — multiple layers of fake.
Q    So, you’re — you’re tasked now — and I pray to God this is successful.  I really do.  I wish you Godspeed.
MR. MUSK:  Yeah.
Q    You know, “Godspeed, John Glenn.”
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s — it’s going to be, by the way.  I really believe it’s going to be.
Q    But — but there —
MR. MUSK:  Oh, yeah.
Q    But there are legitimate areas —
THE PRESIDENT:  Because the country is going to do well beside this.
This is cutting.  We’re only talking about cutting.
We’re also going to make a lot of money.  We’re g- — we’re taking in so much money.
Q    But what about his business?  What if — if there is —
THE PRESIDENT:  Then we won’t let him do it.
Q    — a contract he would otherwise get?
THE PRESIDENT:  We’re not going to let him do it.  He — if —
Q    You’re not going to let him do it?
THE PRESIDENT:  If he’s got a conflict — I mean, look — he —
Q    Y- — now y- —
THE PRESIDENT:  He’s in certain areas — I mean, I see this morning — I didn’t — I didn’t know, but I said, “Do the right thing” — where they’re cutting way back on the electric vehicle subsidies.
MR. MUSK:  Yes.
THE PRESIDENT:  They’re cutting back.
Q    You’re losing —
THE PRESIDENT:  Not only cutting back —
Q    It hurts you.
MR. MUSK:  Correct.
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.
Now, I will tell you —
Q    You don’t care?
MR. MUSK:  Well —
THE PRESIDENT:  He’s probably not that happy with it, but that would have been one thing he would have come to me and said, “Listen, you got to do me a favor.  This is crazy.”  (Laughter.)  But this was in the tax bill.  They’re cutting back on the subsidies.
I didn’t — I wasn’t involved in it.  I said, “Do what’s right, and you get” — and they’re coming up with the tax, but it’s just preliminary.
But I mean, if he were involved, wouldn’t you think he’d probably do that?  Now, maybe he does better if you cut back on the subsidies.  Who knows.  Because he figures — he does think differently.  He thinks he has a better product, and as long as he has a level playing field, he doesn’t care what you do —     MR. MUSK:  Exactly.     THE PRESIDENT:  — which he’s very — he’s told me that.
MR. MUSK:  Yeah.  I mean, I haven’t asked the president for anything ever.
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s true.
Q    And if it comes up, how — how will you handle it?  (Inaudible.)
THE PRESIDENT:  He won’t be involved.
MR. MUSK:  Yeah, I’ll — I’ll re- — I’ll recuse myself if it is a conflict.
THE PRESIDENT:  If there’s a conflict, he won’t be involved.
MR. MUSK:  Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT:  I mean, I wouldn’t want that, and he won’t want it.
MR. MUSK:  Right.  And — and also, I’m getting a — sort of a daily proctology exam here.  You know, it’s not like I’ll be getting away from something in the dead of night.
Q    Welcome to D.C.  If you want a friend, get a dog.
MR. MUSK:  Well, I do have a dog, but I also have friends.  (Laughter.)  My dog loves me, poor little creature.
THE PRESIDENT:  You know the truth was —
MR. MUSK:  I need to bring him to D.C.
THE PRESIDENT:  He’s — I know every businessman.  I know the — the good ones, the bad ones, the smart ones, the lucky ones.  I know them all.  This guy is a ver- — he’s a brilliant guy.  He’s a great guy.  He’s got tremendous imagination and scientific imagin- — far beyond — you know, you keep talking about a technologist and all, but you’re much more than a technologist.  You are that.  But he’s also a good person.  He’s a very good person, and he wants to see the country do well.
And I know a lot of great businesspeople, really great business people, but, you know, they’re not really, in some cases, very good people.  And I know people that would try and take advantage of the situation.
This guy is somebody that really cares for the country, and I saw that very early on.  I saw it, really, a long time ago when I got to know him.  He’s a very different kind of a character.
That’s why — you know who loves him: young people that are very smart and that love the country.  He’s got, like, a tremendous following, because that’s what he’s — he’s a good person.
And he doesn’t need this.  He didn’t need this, and he’s doing this to help the country.  If I didn’t win this election, this country was — I don’t think it could have made it.  I don’t — I mean, we’re allowing criminals — millions of criminals into our country, where everything is transgender, it’s men playing in women’s sports.
I mean, none of this stuff — you could go — I could give you a hundred things.  It’s almost like they’re trying to destroy the fabric of — of the country, of the world, because the world was following us.  Now the world is following us out of this pit.
We’ve done a lot.  I’ll tell you what, in three weeks, we’ve done more — I think we’ve done more — in — in terms of meaningful, not just dollars — than maybe any president ever.  And a lot of people are saying that.
Q    Shock — it’s been shock and awe.
THE PRESIDENT:  I mean, if we can keep it going at this level, this country is going to be at a level that it’s never seen before.
Q    You know one of the things you did that I really thought was pretty clever and smart and fair, and that was reciprocal tariffs.
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, reciprocal.
Q    Ta- — I didn’t know India charged so much.  I didn’t know the European Union to charge them.
MR. MUSK:  Yeah, totally.
Q    I didn’t know Canada was charging us.
THE PRESIDENT:  Everybody.  Everybody.  Everybody but us.
Q    Brazil, why?
THE PRESIDENT:  And I was doing it — you know, I charged China tariffs.  I took in hundreds of billions of dollars, and I was doing that.  But when we got — we had the greatest economy in history.  But then we got hit with COVID, and we had to solve that problem, because I was doing it — and now I said, I want to come back and do the recipri- — because every country in the world almost — we have a deficit with almost every country — not every one, but just about, pretty close.
And — but every country in the world takes advantage of us, and they do it with tariffs.  They makes — make it — it’s impossible for him to sell a car, practically, in, as an example, India.  I don’t know if that’s true or not, but I think —
MR. MUSK:  The tariffs are like 100 percent import duty.
THE PRESIDENT:  The tariffs are so high —
MR. MUSK:  Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT:  — they don’t want to — now, if he built the factory in India, that’s okay, but that’s unfair to us.  It’s very unfair.
And I said, “You know what we do?”  I told Prime Minister Modi yesterday — he was here.  I said, “Here’s what you do.  We’re going to do — be very fair with you.”  They charge the highest tariffs in the world, just about.
Q    36 percent?
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, much — much higher.
MR. MUSK:  It’s 100 percent on — auto imports are 100 percent.
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, that’s peanuts.  So, much higher.  And — and others too.  I said, “Here’s what we’re going to do: reciprocal.  Whatever you charge, I’m charging.”  He goes, “No, no, I don’t like that.”  “No, no, whatever you charge, I’m going to charge.”  I’m doing that with every country.
MR. MUSK:  It seems fair.
Q    Don’t you —
THE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  It does.
MR. MUSK:  It’s — it’s like fair is fair.
THE PRESIDENT:  Nobody can argue with me.  You know, the media can’t argue — I said — they said, “Tariffs — you’re going to charge tariffs?”  You know, if I said, like, 25 percent they’d say, “Oh, that’s terrible.”  I don’t say that anymore —
Q    Can I — (inaudible) —
THE PRESIDENT:  — because I say, “Whatever they charge, we’ll charge.”  And you know what?      Q    They stop.     THE PRESIDENT:  They — then they say, “Oh, that sounds fair.”
MR. MUSK:  All the president is saying is that —     Q    (Inaudible.)     MR. MUSK:  — it needs to be at a level playing field and — and fair and square.
Q    Yeah.  And how does — how —
THE PRESIDENT:  And we’re going to make a lot of money and a lot of businesses are going to come pouring in.
MR. MUSK:  How can you argue with a fair and square situation?
Q    Don’t — don’t you think most of them will look at the — the — for example, without America, China’s economy will tank.  They need our business.
THE PRESIDENT:  They do.  Everybody needs us.
Q    Everybody needs it.
THE PRESIDENT:  And you know what?
Q    Do- — don’t you think they’ll stop?
THE PRESIDENT:  We only have so long left where we’re in this position.  We’re the bank, and the bank is getting smaller and smaller and smaller.  We — we’re the bank.  We got to do this now.  We can’t wait another 10 years and have a shell of a country left, because that’s what was going to happen.
Q    Mr. President —
THE PRESIDENT:  This country — if I didn’t win this election and have people like this man right here that really do care, because that’s the other word — if you don’t care, you could be the smartest guy in the world, it’s not going to matter.  But if we didn’t win this election, I’m telling you, we would not have had a country for very long.
Q    How quickly —
MR. MUSK:  May I say —
Q    — do you balance the budget and — and when do we start paying down that debt?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, potentially, very quickly, between what he’s doing and with income coming in from tariffs and other things.  I mean, I hope we can — I don’t want to give a date, because then these people are going to say, “Oh, well, he didn’t make the date.”  But I think we can do it very quickly.
We would have never done it if this didn’t happen.  Never.  It would have never been — it would only get worse and worse, and ultimately, it would have exploded.
This country was headed down a very bad track.  And the whole DEI thing, that was — that was a trap.  That was a sick trap.
Q    (Inaudible.)     MR. MUSK:  (Inaudible.)
THE PRESIDENT:  And, you know, we’ve destroyed that.  That’s gone.  That’s pretty much gone.
Q    I agree.      MR. MUSK:  (Inaudible) —     Q    We’re not — we’re not funding it.
MR. MUSK:  If — I really want to — I really want to emphasize to people that — this is a very important point — if we don’t solve the deficit, there won’t be money for medical care.  There won’t be money —
THE PRESIDENT:  Right.
MR. MUSK:  — for Social Security.  We either solve the deficit or all we’ll be doing is paying debt.
Q    Nobody —
MR. MUSK:  It’s — it’s got to be solved, or there’s no medical care, there’s no Social Security, there’s no nothing.  That’s got to be solved.  It’s not optional.  America will go bankrupt if this is not done.  That’s why I’m here.
Q    The president’s —
THE PRESIDENT:  Europe takes advantage of us.
MR. MUSK:  And — and I’d like to also just send a message — like, because, as the president said, like, this — there’s a lot of rich people out there.  They should be caring more about the country because — the reason they should be caring about — more about country is: America falls, what do you think is going to happen to your business?  What do — what do you think — do you think you’re be going to be okay if — if the ship of America sinks?  Of course not.
Like, what — what I’m doing here, what the president is doing is it’s just long-term thinking.  The ship of America must be strong.  The ship of America cannot sink.  If it sinks, we all sink with it.
THE PRESIDENT:  Sean, you’re a —
Q    This is what — this is what drives you?
MR. MUSK:  Yes.
Q    This is important.  It says “tech support.”  So, you’re not trying to be president, as the media suggests.  You are really here because your heart and your passion is this.  And the president described you as being — this is the biggest thing you ever done.  Now you trying to bring sight to —
THE PRESIDENT:  There could be nothing bigger.  There’s nothing —
Q    You’re sending ships up to Mars — you know, spaceships up in the sky all the time —
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s peanuts.
Q    — and saving astronauts.  That’s pretty big.
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s peanuts compared to what we’re talking about.
Q    It’s peanuts?
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.
Q    Do you agree with that?
MR. MUSK:  Well, it’s esse- — it’s essential that America be healthy, that America’s economy be strong.  And — and if that — if — basically, like, my concern is like, if — if — America is the central pillar holding up Western civilization.  That pillar must be strong.  If that pillar falls, the whole roof comes crashing down.
THE PRESIDENT:  Including his ships.
MR. MUSK:  There’s no place to hide.
THE PRESIDENT:  Including his ships going up.
MR. MUSK:  There’s no place to run.
THE PRESIDENT:  Nothing.  There’s nothing left.
Q    Why — why, if this is your goal, your motivation, you’re losing money in the process, you’re offeri- — you do all these nice things for people for free; you’re trying to solve, you know, blindness; you’re going to rescue astronauts; you help the people in North Carolina, California; you’re cutting money that was sent abroad that’s not helping the American people, then why the rage —
MR. MUSK:  Actually, I think it was like —     Q    But why this rage?     MR. MUSK:  — it was not helping the American people and hurting people overseas, to be clear.
Q    Why this rage against you now?  First, they hated him.  Now they hate both of you.
MR. MUSK:  Well, I think we’re seeing an antibody reaction from — from those who are receiving the — the wasteful and fraudulent money.
Q    They’re being exposed.
MR. MUSK:  Yes.
Q    Nobody wants to be exposed when you’re corrupt.
MR. MUSK:  I’ll — I’ll tell you a lesson I learned at PayPal.  You know who complained the loudest — the quickest and the loudest and with the most amount of righteous indignation?  The fraudsters.  That’s who complained first, loudest, and — and they would generally have this immense overreaction.  That’s how we knew there were the fraudsters.  That’s how we knew.  There’s a tell.
Q    What di- — I’ve never — I’ve never met you before today.
MR. MUSK:  Yeah.
Q    And it’s nice to meet you, by the way.  Thank — thank you for doing this.
You guys are really friends.  I could s- — you guys — I could see you kicking up your shoes.
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, he doesn’t do this kind of thing.  And the way I figured that you’d get to know him is if I did it with him.  I said, “Come on, let’s do it together.”  He doesn’t do this.
I think he’s smarter not doing it, overall.  Because, you know, I mean, he’s done very well without doing it.  But he doesn’t feel it’s really worthwhile.  He wants the product to speak for itself, or whatever he does speak for itself.  But he views it as — you know, does it matter?
And I’m doing this with you today because I wanted to have people understand him.  And I think it’s very important — I disagree with him.  I think it’s very important that they do understand him.
He doesn’t need this.  He doesn’t need it.  Now, I happen to think it’s made him very popular.  I think it — he’s more popular now because there are so many people — you know, you’re talking about the radical left — they have the lowest ratings.  MSNBC is dying.  CNN is dying.  They’re all dying.  The New York Times is doing lousy.  The Washington Post is doing horribly.  They’re all doing badly because people don’t buy it anymore.
But I think it was important that he do this one interview.  You’ve been a very fair guy.  I think you were the right guy to do it.  If we could get some radical left guy — and he’d do just as well, frankly, because it’s all about common sense.
Q    They would attack him —
THE PRESIDENT:  But this — Sean —
Q    — as being unconstitutional, not — a fascist.
THE PRESIDENT:  — to me this was a — it was important for people to understand, he’s doing a big job.  He’s doing a very thankless job.  He’s doing a thankless job, but he’s helping us to save our country.
Our country was in serious trouble, and I had to get the best guy, somebody with credibility, because if he were just a regular, good — very good, solid businessman, he wouldn’t have the credibility.  He’s got the best credibility for this.
And people also know he’s an honest guy.  He’s an honest guy.  He’s just a very, very smart guy who’s done amazing things.  And this will be the biggest thing he’s ever done, because, you know, his companies are all great.  But if this country goes bad — I guess where he is a little selfish is this.  He knows one thing and probably doesn’t think — but if his — if this country goes bad, his stuff is not going to be worth very much, I can tell you.
MR. MUSK:  Well, I’d say, if the — if the ship of America sinks, we’re all go- — going down with it.  You know, this idea that people can escape to New Zealand or some other place is false.  If the central pillar of Western civilization that is America falls, the whole roof comes crashing down and there is no escape.
Q    It’s amazing, since you’ve been elected, to watch Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia — I — I was shocked at the statements that Vladimir Putin made about you.  I — I was shocked at the hostage release.  I was shocked that Venezuela had done it — had done it.  Zelenskyy wants a deal.  Putin wants a deal.
THE PRESIDENT:  All good statements.
Q    King Abdullah was interested.
THE PRESIDENT:  You mean by that all good statements.  Look, they respect the president of this country.  They respect — they did not respect the last president.  They laughed at him, and they laughed at our country, and he’s done great damage to our country.
Q    Have foreign leaders told you what they thought of Biden?
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, they have, but I’d rather not say.  They — they have.  It’s not — it — look —
Q    It’s the obvious.
THE PRESIDENT:  He was not George Washington, let’s put it that way.
MR. MUSK:  (Inaudible.)
THE PRESIDENT:  Not the greatest.
Q    Sorry, if that’s (inaudible).
THE PRESIDENT:  He’s done a tremendous disservice.
Q    Will you be here —
THE PRESIDENT:  And, by the way, the Democrats have done a great disservice, and they ought to get their act together and use a little judgment, and they ought to work with us on straightening out this mess that —
Q    Who?  John Fetterman?
THE PRESIDENT:  — a lot of people have —
Q    Maybe?  Who — what Democrat is not radicalized?
THE PRESIDENT:  Actually, you mention John.
Q    John Fetterman.
THE PRESIDENT:  He’s become the best voice in the Democrat party.  You know, I had lunch with him, and I thought he was terrific, but he’s a much different man than he was before he had this difficulty.  He used to be radical left, and I think he became much smarter, actually.  He’s really — he’s really a voice of reason.
But the Democrats have to get together.  They have to get their act together, because the stuff they — they talk about makes no sense.  It makes — none whatsoever.  And they must know it.  They must know.
MR. MUSK:  Yeah.  I mean, like, the country has spoken very clearly and rejected the core tenets of the Demo- — Democratic Party.  The country voted t- — fo- — I mean, the country made the — America has made its vote clear.  The president won the popular vote decisively.  The Republicans won the House.  Repub- — Republicans won the Senate.  What more do you need?
The Democratic Party needs to take a hard look in the mirror and — and change their ways.
Q    I think they went from shock, denial, into the depression stage of grief, and now they’re in the rage stage, where I anticipate they’ll stay for four years, and if they get the chance, they’ll want to impeach him 10 times.  Do you anticipate you’ll be here in four years?  My last question.
MR. MUSK:  I’ll — I’ll be as helpful as long as I can be helpful.
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s a good question.  I mean, I was thinking about that just now.  I said, “I wonder how long he’s going to be doing it.”  You can’t get somebody like this.  He cares, and he’s brilliant, and he’s got energy.
You need energy, also, in addition to those other things.
You know, I have a lot of guys that are very smart, but they have no energy.  They want to sleep all day long.  You need a lot of energy.  He’s got a lot of energy.  He’s doing a great job.
If there’s any conflict, he — he will stop it.  But if he didn’t, I’d stop it.  I’d see if there’s a conflict.  I mean, we’re talking about big stuff.
But he’s under a pretty big microscope.
MR. MUSK:  Yeah, seriously.
THE PRESIDENT:  I mean, everybody is watching him.  If there’s a conflict, you’re going to be reading about it within about two minutes after the conflict.
MR. MUSK:  Exactly.  There — there’s — the possibility of me getting away with something is 0 percent — 0.0.  I — I’m scrutinized to a ridiculous degree.
And — and the other thing is that we — you know, what — what’s — you know what’s better than saying “trust — trust me” is just full transparency.  So, what we’re doing with — with the DOGE — DOGE dot — just go to DOGE.gov.  You can see every single action that’s being taken.
And now –and I want to be clear, we are going to make some mistakes.  We’re not going to be perfect.  Nobody bats a thousand.  But we’re going to fix the mistakes very quickly.  That’s what matters: not that you don’t make mistakes, but that you fix the mistakes very fast.
THE PRESIDENT:  And you’re going to ask the other side, when they talk about, “This is a constitutional crisis,” you got to a- — what are they paying for?  Where are those tax — because when you read off the list of things, it’s a big con job.  See, when they talk Constitution —
MR. MUSK:  Totally.
THE PRESIDENT:  — it’s a total con job.
MR. MUSK:  Yes.
THE PRESIDENT:  They never talk — and I watch some of the shows —
MR. MUSK:  It’s specifics — they avoid specifics.
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, when you start talking about how did — how come they spent money on transgender here and transgender there —
MR. MUSK:  Yeah, totally.
THE PRESIDENT:  — and all the stuff in some country that nobody ever heard of, they don’t want to talk about it.  They just talk about, “This is a constitutional crisis.”
Q    It shocks the conscious.
THE PRESIDENT:  The money is being squandered purposely — tremendous theft, tremendous kickbacks, everything — and we’re straightening it out.  And thank goodness.  I look up, and I say, “Thank you,” because I think if it went on for four more years, it would not be salvageable.  You wouldn’t be able —
MR. MUSK:  Absolutely.
THE PRESIDENT:  You wouldn’t be able to save it.
Q    You believe, too, that when you were in Butler, came within a millimeter being assassinated —
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.
Q    The day you endorsed him, that was that day.
MR. MUSK:  Yes.
Q    But you had been planning on it?
MR. MUSK:  Yeah.
Q    Pretty — I think everybody will never forget that iconic blood on your face.  “Fight, fight, fight.”  I actually was afra- — watching it and thought you might drop again.  You know, I didn’t know if it had hit you.  You can sometimes get up and then the blood starts to accumulate.  It was scary — pretty scary.
MR. MUSK:  Well, I mean, th- — this is how you know someone’s true character, because everyone can say they’re brave, but the president was actually shot.  Okay?  Courage under fire.  “Fight, fight, fight,” blood streaming down the face.  That’s true courage.  You can’t fake that.
Q    Yeah.  Thank you both.      Mr. President, thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
Q    Appreciate it.  Elon, thank you for your time.  Really nice to meet you.
NA",21,na na a m est q mr president great to see you again the president thank you very much thank you q how are you the president thank you q elon musk mr musk hi q great to see you mr musk thanks thanks for having me q i ve been reading a lot about you i ve got to start with this so he s working for free with doge he s he s kind of put a lot of his life on hold and you sued twitter a number of years ago you just made him pay you $ million the president that s right that s right q that s that s right laughs the president well i sued i sued from long before he had it mr musk yeah yeah inaudible the president and i mean they really did a number on me you know and i sued and they had to pay you know they paid $ million settlement q you re okay with that mr musk i mean i left it up to the lawyers and you know the team running twitter so i said you guys do what you think is the right makes sense q i think it s funny the president i think q because the president it s a very low i was looking to get much more money than that q so you gave him a discount w in the lawsuit the president he got oh he got a big discount i don t think he even knows about it q he s become one of your if you read and believe the media he s become one of your best friends he s working for free for you he s mr musk well i love the president i just want to be clear about that q you don t care about that mr musk i no i love the pr i q you love the president mr musk i think i think president trump is a good man and and he s you know i i the president that s the way he said that you know there s something nice about laughter mr musk no it is i you know the president it is mr musk because i mean the president has been so so unfairly attacked in the media it s truly outrageous and i ve sp at this point spent a lot of time with the president and not once have i seen him do something that was mean or cruel or or wrong not once q you know i ve known him for years mr musk yeah q and i ve never seen anybody take as much as he s taken mr musk yeah q and we ve discussed this and i m like how do you deal with it the president did have a choice laughs i didn t have a choice q well you would say that to me i m like what what am i going to do worry about it the president that s the only thing i can say q and you know and then culminating in two assassination attempts which resulted in your endorsement mr musk well i was going to do it anyway but that was q that was it mr musk a precipitating event yeah the president that speeded it up a little bit mr musk yeah yeah q the day of the assassination the president nice i didn t know that mr musk yeah it just it sped it up but i was going to do it anyway q mr president with your indulgence i m convinced that people only know a little bit about elon i don t think they know everything about elon because as i studied for and prepared for this interview i learned a lot about you that i didn t know i think people will think about tesla democrats are demonizing you and and trying to make the country hate you i just want people to understand you a little bit better and the person that you ve gotten to know and have now put a lot of trust in the president sure q and you know just let s go over a little bit of your bio starting mr musk ah okay q with paypal and how you became involved in tesla and spacex and neuralink mr musk this this could take a while q and all these mr musk i mean you know i i think the way you think of me is like i m a technologist and i try to make technologies that improve the world and make life better q you can show them your shirt mr musk yeah and that s why like my t shirt says tech support laughter because i m here to provide the president with with technology support and now that that may seem like well is that a silly thing but actually it s a very important thing because the president will make these executive orders which are very sensible and good for the country but then they don t get implemented you know so if you take the for example all the funding for the migrant hotels the president issued an executive order hey we need to stop taking taxpayer money and and paying for luxury hotels for illegal immigrants q it s crazy mr musk which makes no sense like obviously people do not want their tax dollars going to to fund high end hotels for for illegals and yet they were still doing that even as late as last week and so you know we went in there and we were like this is in violation of the presidential executive order it needs to stop so so what we re what we re doing here is is one of the biggest functions of the doge team is just making sure that the presidential executive orders are actually carried out and this is i just want to point out this is a very important thing because the president is the elected representative of the people so he s representing the will of the people and if the bureaucracy is fighting the will of the people and preventing the pres the president from implementing what the people want then what we live in is a bureaucracy and not a democracy q yeah you you re both aware you have to be keenly aware that the media and and the punditry class not that you know i think you ve proven they have no power anymore because they threw everything they had at you and they didn t win and that was you know the new york times washington post three networks every late night comedy show two cable channels they they just threw they threw everything lawfare weaponization the president it s true q and now i see they want you two to start they want a divorce they want you two to start hating each other and they try oh president elon musk for example you do know that they re doing that to you the president oh i see it all the time they tried it then they stopped that wasn t they have many different things of hatred actually elon called me he said you know they re trying to drive us apart i said absolutely you know they said we have breaking news donald trump has ceded control of the presidency to elon musk president musk will be attending a cabinet meeting tonight at o clock laughter and i say it s just so obvious they re so bad at it i used to think they were good at it they re actually bad at it because if they were good at it i d never be president because i i think nobody in history has ever gotten more bad publicity than me i could do the greatest things i get percent bad publicity i could do outside of you and a few of your very good friends it s like the craziest thing but you know what i have learned elon the people are smart they get it mr musk yeah they do actually yeah the president they get it they really see what s happening mr musk yes q and at the end of this interview i what i would like is i i want people to know the relationship and know more about you what is the relationship mr president the president well i respect him i ve always respected him i never knew that he was right on certain things and i m usually pretty good at this stuff he did starlink he did things that were so advanced and nobody knew what the hell they were i can tell you in north carolina they had no communication they were wiped out those people were you know they had rivers in between land that never saw water all of a sudden there was a river and a vicious like rapids people were dying all over they had no communication they said do you know elon musk and they didn t really know i knew him i said yeah they said could you get starlink it s like the first time i ever heard of it i said what s starlink a communication system that s unbelievable q i have it the president and he yeah and he said i called him and i said listen they really need it and he got like thousands of units of this communication and it saved a lot of lives he got it immediately and you can t get it i mean you have to wait a long time to get it but he got it to him immediately and i said that s pretty amazing and i didn t even know he had it we watch the rocket ships and we watch tesla i think you know something that had an effect on me was when i saw the rocket ship come back and get grabbed like you grab a beautiful little baby you grab your baby it just mr musk just hug the rocket the president i d never seen mr musk everyone right everyone needs inaudible q you hug the rocket you hug the rocket mr musk inaudible rockets the president yeah no but and he said you know you can t really have a rocket program if you re going to dump a billion dollars into the ocean every time you fly you have to save it and he saved it first time q that s ever been done the president i ve ever seen that done now nobody else can do it if you look at the u s russia or china they can t do it and they won t be able to do it for a long time he has the technology so you learn i wanted somebody really smart to work with me in terms of the country a very important aspect because i mean he doesn t talk about it he s actually a very good businessman and when he talks about the executive orders and this is probably true for all presidents you write an executive order and you think it s done you send it out it doesn t get done it doesn t get implemented they don t implement it they maybe they re from the last administration and they are in some cases you try and get them out as fast as you can but i could as soon as he said that i said you know that s interesting you write a beautiful executive and you sign it and you assume it s going to be done but it s not what he does is he takes it and with his hundred geniuses he s got some very brilliant young people working for him that dress much worse than him actually mr musk yeah they do the president they dress in just t shirts laughter you wouldn t know they have iq q wait wait so what he s he s your tech support mr musk i the president no no he is mr musk i actually virtually am tech support the president he s much more than that mr musk i actually am tech support though but that s the president but he gets it done he s a leader he really is a he gets it done you get a lot of tech people and you have people they re good with tech but they he gets it done you know i said in real estate you had guys that would draw beautiful renderings of a building and they d draw the rendering it would be great and you d say great when are you starting but they were never able to get it built they couldn t get the finances they couldn t get the approvals it would never get done and then you have other guys that are able to get it done you know they could just get it done i was in real estate same thing in this he gets it done so when he said that he said you know when you sign these executive orders a lot of them don t get done and maybe the most important ones and he would take that executive order that i d signed and he would have those people go to whatever agency it was when are you doing it get it done get it done and some guy that maybe didn t want to do it all of a sudden he s signing he just doesn t want to bothered q does do a lot of those executive orders have to be codified into law to do you need the republican congress to follow up the president yeah and they will a lot of them will be yeah q they will the president look in the meantime we have four years the beauty is we have four years that s why i like doing it right at the beginning because an executive order is great i mean the one problem it s both good and bad because when they did all these executive orders i ve canceled most of them they were terrible i mean we were going to go radical left communist okay it was crazy their mr musk really crazy the president executive orders were so bad if they ever got them codified you d never be able to break them so the damage that biden has done to this country and it s not even biden it s the people that circled him in the oval office okay but the damage they did to this country in terms of let s say open borders you know there s so many things but open borders where millions of people poured into our country and hundreds of thousands of those people are criminals they re murderers they re drug dealers they re gang members they re people from prisons from all over the world and we have a great guy tom homan and he is doing so incredibly you saw the numbers they re down like percent q ninety five percent the president he is a phenomenal guy and kristi noem is doing an unbelievable job and he wanted her he said she s so tough and i said i don t think of her as that way you know she s very nice he said no she s so tough and she is i see her with the horses she s riding the horse let s laughter she s great but the team we have is is really unbelievable but those executive orders i sign them and now they get passed on to him and his group and other people and they re all getting done we re getting them done q let me go back a little bit to your background because mr musk sure q it s beyond impressive you were the chief engineer for example you were an early believer in tesla you became the ceo and and then the chief engineer which was phenomenal spacex same thing which is unbelievable i mean you were the first company private company to send astronauts successfully into into space first private company to send astronauts into orbit mr musk yeah q that s that s pretty deep the president he s going to go into orbit soon q okay mr musk laughs yeah the president no he s going to go to mars he s going to fly on his q starlink mr musk at some point yeah q as in inaudible mr musk but they say they always ask me like do you want to die on mars and i say well yes but not on impact laughter q star starlink is in countries this is going to be hard i feel like i m interviewing two brothers here mr musk you go ahead q starshield which could be used for national defense mr musk yeah it is already being used for national defense q then you have a what is it called optimus a part of tesla mr musk they re a robot yeah q a robotic arm then you have an ai arm and then you have something that really fascinated me and it s called neuralink mr musk yes q you might help the blind to see and people with spinal cord injuries that they that they can recover where in the past how close is that to becoming a success mr musk at neuralink we re we ve ha we ve implanted neuralink in three patients so far who are quadriplegics and it allows them to directly control their phone and computer just using their mind just by thinking it s like so we call this product telepathy so you control your computer and phone just by thinking and it s possible to actually control the computer and phone faster than someone who has working hands then the next step would be to add a second neuralink implant past the point where these the neurons are damaged so that somebody can walk again and so the pe they can have full body functionality restored and the president and you like bobby right mr musk i like bobby actually yeah i i supported bobby kennedy i think he you know he s unfairly maligned as someone who is anti science but i think he he isn t he just wants to question the science which is the essence of the science the scientific method fundamentally is about always questioning the science q well they didn t tell us the truth about covid mr musk correct q that s for sure mr musk yes q and we learned a lot with the twitter files and that just then raises a question you re the richest man in the world you may not like that part the president yeah q you re pretty competitive mr musk i mean it s neither here nor there q i ve known you a long time mr musk i don t think it matters q but the president that s why i became president q he s on your team the president inaudible q well that s true he can t top that the president he s good you know i wanted to find somebody smarter than him i searched all over i just couldn t do it i couldn t i couldn t q you really tried hard the president i couldn t find anyone smarter right so we had to we had to for the country q but this is the thing the president so we settled on we settled on this guy mr musk well thanks for having me the president laughs yeah q so mr musk i m just trying to be useful here q but this is the interesting but this is where we are as a so a society and i i hate to do this to you but i m going to do it anyway you re doing all of these things at doge nobody at doge gets paid a penny correct mr musk well actually some people are federal employees so they do q oh okay mr musk yeah they re inaudible but it s fair to say that the software engineers at doge could be earning millions of dollars a year and instead of earning a small fraction of that as federal employees q okay so just the president and they re very committed people mr musk yes q so you re you re committed to helping the blind see people with spinal cord injuries recover mr musk yes q you re committed to getting to mars you re committed to rescue you re going to help rescue next month two astronauts that i think were abandoned they they dispute that in an interview the president when are you when are you getting them mr musk at the at the president s request we or instruction we are accelerating the return of the astronauts which was postponed kind of to a ridiculous degree the president they got left in space q they ve been there they were supposed to be there eight days they re there almost the president biden mr musk they were put q yeah mr musk yes they were left up there for political reasons which is not good q okay it s not good now if i had the weight and pressure of doing that successfully on my shoulders i think i d be you know but you when we spoke before we did this interview you were very confident you think this will be a successful mission mr musk well we don t want to be complacent but we have brought astronauts back from the space station many times before and always with success so as long as we re not complacent the president when are they when are you going to launch mr musk i think it s about about four weeks to bring them back q about four weeks mr musk yeah the president and you have the go ahead mr musk we re being extremely cautious q yeah the president you now have the go ahead mr musk yes well thanks to you the president they didn t have the go ahead with biden q what s that the president he was going to leave him in space i think he was going to leave them in space q well it s like the inaudible the president he considered it a q growing up lost in space the president yeah he didn t want the publicity can you believe it q unbelievable and so mr musk yeah q i want to echo something that the president said and then ask an overarching question so people in get hit with hurricane helene they have no communication with the outside world you come to the rescue you donated that i believe mr musk yes yes q you donated to the people of the president he saved a lot of lives in north carolina he saved a lot of lives q and california after the wildfires the president california but i mean in north carolina where they were really in trouble they had no communication people were dying q nothing the president they were dying of starvation he saved a lot of lives in north carolina q okay now you re going to rescue astronauts and now again you do you do all of this i would think liberals would love the fact that you have the biggest electric vehicle company in the world mr musk yeah i mean i used to be adored by the left you know q not anymore mr musk le less so these days q he killed that huh mr musk i mean less the president i really inaudible mr musk well i mean this this whole sort of like you know it was they call it like trump derangement syndrome and i didn t you know you don t realize how real this is until like it s you can t reason with people so like i was at a friend s birthday party in l a just a birthday dinner and it was like a nice quiet dinner and everything was everyone was behaving normally and then i happened to mention this was before the election like a month or two before i happened to mention the president s name and it was like they got shot with a dart in the jugular that contained like the methamphetamine and rabies okay laughter and they re like whyy and i m like what is wrong like guys like you just can t have like a normal conversation and it s like it s like they become completely irrational q he he has no idea if you re friends with him mr musk yeah q you pay a price you know it s like i walk into a restaurant in new york and it s like half the room gets daggers and they want to mr musk the eye daggers eye daggers level is insane laughter i mean there was like i had like some some invitation because so i got invited to like so basically a big sort of damn damn event like that was but i d received the invitation like the beginning of last year and then and i still attended even after i d endorsed president trump and i didn t realize how profoundly that would affect you know how i was received laughter i mean i walk into the room and i m getting just the dirty looks from from everyone like if looks could kill i would have been dead several times over q but that was not laughter before trump mr musk inaudible q before trump bc mr musk ashes on the floor laughs q or bt before trump that never happened right mr musk no q no so mr musk i i just doesn t seem strange like what what is up with this total like madness q you re smarter than me can you i actually think that there s a level of irrationality it s almost like a trigger and mr musk it totally triggers q and it s like look i i ve been on tv this is my th year i ve been on radio years i will i ve gone hard in the paint to for candidates that lost mr musk yeah q and guess what i get over it mr musk sure yeah yeah q and i just keep doing my show and i just you know i come back to fight another day so here s the big then this is the million dollar or billion dollar i m among billionaires question so you have all this going on and you stop in a way you re still doing it and you partner with him and this is what you get for it from the democrats you get nobody voted for elon well nobody voted for any of your cabinet nominees okay people are dying because of doge cuts i ll give you a chance to respond to all that what doge is doing is illegal elon musk is more street vernacular for a male body part it s a constitutional crisis mr musk how c why why are they reacting like this q well first of all do you give a flying rip number one and mr musk well i guess we must be if we re the target we re doing something right you know if like they wouldn t be complaining so much if they we weren t doing something useful i think what all we re really trying to do here is restore the will of the people through the president and and what we re finding is there s an unelected bureaucracy speaking of unelected there s a there s a vast federal bureaucracy that is implacably opposed to the the president and the cabinet and you look at say d c voting it s percent kamala okay so we re in percent kamala that s a lot q yeah they don t like me here either mr musk i think about that number a lot i m like percent that s basically almost everyone and so but if but how can you if if the will of the president is not implemented and the president is representative of the people that means the will of the people is not being implemented and that means we don t live in a democracy we live in a bureaucracy and so i think what we re seeing here is the sort of the thrashing of the bureaucracy as we try to restore democracy and the will of the people q you mr musk is this making sense i mean sorry q y no of course it does i mean to me if you look at our framers and our founders and you ve really become a student of history mr president and we ve ta we ve had conversations both on air and off air and if we talk about constitutional order or transformational change nobody can argue that what s happening here is going at the speed of light but however what were the principles of our framers and our founders they wanted limited government greater freedom for the people and we ll get to the specific cutting of waste fraud and abuse that that is your goal is it not the president yeah and my goal was to get great people and when you look at what this man has done i mean it was something i knew him a little bit through the white house originally i d see him around a little bit i didn t know him before that and i respected what he did and he fought hard you know he was a he was maybe questioned for a while he was having some difficulties it was not easy doing what he did i mean how many people have started a car company and made it really successful and made a better car where it s you know beating these big companies that that s all they do is cars i mean it s really amazing the things that he s done but i didn t know it as much then as now i mean the fruits have sort of taken hold but i wanted great people and he s a great person he s an amazing person he s also a caring person you know he uses the word care so they sign a contract in a government agency and it has three months and the guy leaves that signed the contract and nobody else is there and they pay the contract for years so the guy is getting checks for years and years and years and he s telling his family obviously maybe it was crooked maybe he paid to get the contract or maybe he paid that they didn t terminate him but you know we have contracts that go forever and they ve been going for years and they re supposed to end in three months or five months or two years or something and they go forever so the guy is either crooked you know where he knew this was going to happen or he s crooked because he s getting payments that he knows he shouldn t be getting mr musk yeah the president but they re finding things like that they re finding things far worse than that and they re finding billions and it will be hundreds of billions of dollars worth of fraud i say waste and abuse but fraud waste and abuse and he s doing an amazing job and he attracts a young very smart type of person i call them high iq individuals and they are they re very high q and high iq and when they go in to see the people and talk to these people you know the people think they re going to pull it over they don t these guys are smart and they love the country you know there s a certain something but he uses the word care so people have to care like when i bought air force one mr musk exactly the president i negotiated the price it was $ billion and i got it i got them down $ billion now they re not building the plane fast enough i mean they re actually in default boeing they re supposed to q when is it the president they ve been building this thing forever i don t know q this is the new air force one the president what s going on mr musk yeah the president we don t build the way we used to build you know we used to build like a ship a day and now to build a ship is like a big deal and we re going to get this country back on track we could do it but so many things it takes so long to get things built and get things done and a lot of it could be something we ve been discussing the regulators go in and they make it impossible to build they make it very difficult to build anything whether it s a ship a plane or a building or anything and some of them do it because they want to show how important they are some of them do it maybe because they think they re right they use the environment to stop progress and to stop things it s always the environment it s an environmental problem it s not an environmental problem at all but they do a lot of things and by the way speaking of that lee zeldin is going to be fantastic in the position so important he could take years to approve or disapprove something or he could do it in a month you know just as good q sure the president and i think you re going to see some fantastic a fantastic job done by him he s a tremendous guy q newt you echoed something when i had just met you and it was very similar to what newt has been saying that we re he brought this country to the dance this is the opportunity to be transformational and to have i would argue a the most consequential presidency if we if we d really dig down and do something that had never been done before and that is get rid of this bureaucracy and i m going mr musk yes q to get to specifics you say the same thing it s not done yet mr musk absolutely q and what did you mean by that mr musk well i mean the w winning the election is really the opportunity to fix the system it is not fixing the system itself so it s an opportunity to fix the system and to restore the power of democracy and you know people like it s funny how how often it you when these attacks occur the thing that they re accusing the administration of is what they are guilty of they re saying that things are are being done are unconstitutional but what they are doing is unconstitutional they are guilty of the crime of which they accuse us the president that s always the first thing they do mr musk yeah the president he s in violation of the constitution they don t even know what they re talking well they know mr musk it s absurd the president it s just a con job it s a big con job and they re so bad for the country so dangerous and so bad and the media is so bad when i watch msnbc which i don t watch much but you have to watch the enemy on occasion the level of arrogance and and cheating and they re just horrible people these are horrible people q they lie the president these are horrible people q they tell conspiracy theories the president they lie and they start up with the constitution they couldn t care less about the constitution cnn likewise i mean i watched them asking questions with you know the hatred with the why i said what are you asking the question with such anger you re asking me a normal question but you see the bias the bias is so incredible those two are bad pbs is bad ap is bad cbs is terrible i mean cbs now they changed an answer in kamala they asked her some questions she answered them like you know a low iq person the opposite of him the absolute opposite but she gave a horrible answer they took the entire answer out and they put another answer that she gave minutes later into the in as the answer q it was part of her word salad the president i ve never even heard of that be i thought i heard of it all mr musk right q that wh minutes once one wanted to do an interview with me and i said live to tape mr musk yeah exactly q they said no and i said no mr musk right q no deal mr musk exactly they can q like this interview will the president i ve never even heard you know i ve seen where they take a sentence off or something and they ll do but they q sometimes you cut for time o the president no no they took the entire this long terrible statement that she made and put another nobody s ever seen what s happening and you know the people that do all this complaining they re very dishonest people mr musk yeah q yeah i i m going to just for the sake of saving time the president yeah q because i could spend and i ve done this on radio and tv i i can spend an hour finding the outrageous amounts of money being spent abroad like usaid mr musk sure q and i do want to mention a couple but i m going to mr musk yeah q scroll it and mr musk well well i guess at a high level i think it s what the president mentioned earlier which is that in order to save taxpayer money it comes down to two things competence and caring and the president that s right mr musk and when when president was shown the outrageous bill for the new air force one and and then negotiated it down if he had if the president had not applied competence and caring the price would have been percent higher literally percent higher the president cared the president was competent the price was not percent higher as the result and so when you add more competence and caring you get a better deal for the american people the president but we could take we were talking about this yesterday i could take give me thousands of bills any i could pick any one of them and i could mr musk yes exactly the president take all thousand and let s say it s a bill for $ just $ and it s done by some bureaucrat and if he would say i ll give you three i don t want to pay you five it s too high i ll give you three but they don t do that if a guy sends in a bill for $ they pay $ they expect to be cut everybody expects to be cut when you send in a bill you expect to be cut they send in the bill higher for the most part this is true with lawyers legal fees when they send in legal fees you i can cut i wish i had the time i would save so but i could cut these bills in half much better than half but you offer people a much lower number because you know they they actually put fat i m not even saying it s it s like a way of business they put more on because they expect to be negotiated when you send in a bill to the government there s nobody to negotiate mr musk yes the president you send it a bill for $ and they send you a check back for $ if you would call them and said we ll give you five no no no i need more than five we ll give you a five i m not going to pay any more than five make it six no i m not going to make it six and you ll settle for $ you ve just cut the bill almost in half and it took like two minutes when did that stop but q inaudible the art of the deal the president that s caring no it s not even the art of the deal it s caring he uses the word mr musk it s it s competence and caring the president it s caring q yeah the president it s it s a certain competence but i think it s more caring mr musk i if you the president inaudible mr musk actually if you add either ingredient either competence or caring you ll you ll get a better outcome but it stands to reason q right people don t want to do this inaudible mr musk that s the reason that if you don t have competency and you don t have caring you re going to get a terrible deal and the problem is that the american taxpayer has been been getting a terrible deal because look at the last administration can you can anyone can any reasonable person say that last administration was either competent or caring q but they lied to us and said that joe didn t have a cognitive decline mr musk they fully lied q they said the borders were closed they said that the borders were secure they said that mr musk right q you know they said obamacare would save mr musk they flat out lied q they flat out lied mr musk it was insane q on many occasions mr musk yes q i tell my audience all the time don t trust government mr musk yes q so the i want as i scroll this information and it s it s i ll scroll a lot more than i ll mention to both of you and this is the cost savings i want you i want people at home to understand this part the average american makes $ a year mr musk yeah q okay we have $ trillion in national debt mr musk yes q now all the money i m about to mention and what we re going to scroll on our screen and all of this is going to foreign countries it is not being spent here in america mr musk yes q for better schools law and order mr musk i i think the average taxpaying american should be mad as hell because their tax money is being poorly spent q i m mad it s stealing from mr musk it s a it s an outrage q our kids and grandkids mr musk yes and the and people the president and a lot of fraud sean a lot of fraud q yes the president and a lot of kickbacks they re sending money out they re not that stupid these people aren t that stupid they re sending for transgender something having to do with the opera and they re sending out $ million mr musk laughs literally the president $ million inaudible q you just stole my next line i can t believe that the president no it s incredible q i was going to mention that the president no but it s incredible $ million now you know they they re not so stupid they re sending all this money they expect to get a lot of it back and that s what happens q okay so let s go through it mr musk yes they re a bunch of q so for the average person at home mr musk this stuff is round tripping to the president s point they ll they ll make it sound like it s going to help some people in a foreign country but then they then they get kickbacks q all right let me go to the ne to the fir mr musk yeah q to the second question first i want to know because people like joni ernst and and house mr musk yeah joni joni ernst has been q they tried to get mr musk has tried for a long time and she s actually got a lot of good data senator ernst has been really helpful actually q okay but they they actually hide what the real purpose of the spending is mr musk that s true q in other words they and and h this is a question how did you decipher it will say humanitarian blah blah blah in serbia or afghanistan we ve been giving money to china for crying out loud which i think is nuts mr musk well we re giving money to the taliban q money to the taliban mr musk like a lot q all right so mr musk laughs i m like for what q but they mr musk i i want to see pictures of what they did q but they try to obscure it and and but then you got to the bottom line which is what i m now scrolling on the screen mr musk yes q and that is $ million on a sesame street show in iraq $ million to boost tourism in tunisia and egypt $ million to build schools in jordan $ million to tell the vietnamese to stop burning trash $ million for dei scholarships in burma $ million for consultant driven esg investments in africa dei programs in serbia the president s favorite i m sure you you love that taxpayer money was spent on a dei musical in ireland or a chan transgender opera in colombia or a mr musk if i could like it sounds like q transgender comic book in peru mr musk it sounds like it sounds like how can these things be real but this is actually what was done q okay the i mr musk it it sounds like a comedy sketch or something it s like q i have pages of this mr musk right it s not the list is a mile long the president the one thing you didn t mention the media the media is getting millions of dollars mr musk yes the president now they say politico which is a radical left q subscriptions the president you know garbage magazine or or program i guess they have magazine and they have some some media of all types $ million i hear the new york times got a lot i hear they get subscriptions where they have subscriptions but maybe the paper is not sent i have no idea if that s true or not but it s they call it subscriptions lots of subscri to different media not just the times maybe the times and maybe not the times q a million dollars in subscriptions is a lot the president well but but millions of dollars going to media that s radical left crooked dishonest media mr musk well well reuters this is actually really wild reuters got like something like $ million for something that was literally titled mass disinformation campaign q well mr musk that was on the purchase order well i i thought that was a little bold laughs q i will tell you what was bold is when you released mr musk i m like q the twitter files mr musk shouldn t you at least try to call it something else laughs q the twitter files how they targeted him how twitter at the time worked closely with the fbi the cia and even before the release of hunter s very real laptop they were feeding them disinformation that mr musk absolutely q you found all that out mr musk well i think q that s called transparency right the president the fbi has to be rehabbed the fbi mr musk yeah the president what s happened with the fbi and the doj is just their their stock has gone way down i mean their reputation is shot q and intelligence the president and i think pam is going to do great i think kash is going to do great i think they have to do great or we have a problem but when you look at what they did the raid of mar a lago the raid of mar a lago you look at what they did their reputation is shot q it is what you were going to say elon mr musk well no i was going to say that i think probably a like a lot of people still q how how did you find inaudible mr musk still believe like the russia hoax even though you ve done a lot to combat that the you know the the steele dossier was an incre a massive scam that was concocted by hillary clinton and her her campaign q she bought and paid it for it mr musk right q russian disinformation mr musk there was it was the people still think the the russia hoax is real like a lot of people s because they never they never heard the counterpoint i mean i mean a bunch of people should be in prison for that that was a that was outrageous election interference creating a fake russia hoax q how much if you had to put a number on it how much do you think you ve identified waste fraud abuse corruption at this point and again we ve been we re going to be scrolling this throughout the program mr musk well the the overall goal is to try to get a trillion dollars out of the deficit and if we if we if the deficit is not brought under control america will go bankrupt this is a very important thing for people to understand a country is no different from an individual in that if an individual overspends an individual can go bankrupt and so can a country and and the out the massive waste fraud and abuse that has been going on which is leading to a $ trillion a year deficit that that s what the president was handed on jan th a $ trillion deficit it s insane q for this fiscal year the president two trill yeah we inherited it mr musk two the president yeah and inflation is back i m only here for two and a half weeks q that was january the president inflating is back q you were there for a week the president no think of it inflation is back and they said oh trump infla i had nothing to do with it these people have have run the country they spent money like nobody has ever spent they were they were given $ trillion to throw out the window $ trillion and they spent it on the green new scam i call it it s the greatest scam in the history of the country one of them we have a lot of them i guess but one of them q well the president dollar wise probably q and dei the president it is q and wokeism the president yeah yeah q and transgenderism the president well that s all part of it yeah q and lgbtq+ mr musk yes q and by the way not in america other countries not here the president you know the amazing thing is when you see like the teaching of dei $ million how do you spend $ million to teach no matter what it is mr musk right the president you could teach physics mr musk exactly totally the president you could go to mit for a lot less mr musk it s inaudible expensive laughs expensive the president yeah the teaching mr musk expensive bs the president of dei q well i think it would be better spent on the president no it s a kickback it s got to be a kickback nobody is that nobody could do that nobody is q well it the president nobody is giving to assess the dialog of an audience coming out of a theater $ million q how much do you believe elon you ve identified in in waste fraud abuse corruption now and how much mr musk well q do you anticipate you will mr musk sure well the i i think the president one percent mr musk laughs the president no because it s so massive it s this is mr musk yeah exactly the president huge money huge money look q so what we ve found now is one percent mr musk well we ve j we ve just gotten started here the president as good as they are they re not going to find some contract that was crooked you know crooked as hell and i mean there s going to be so much that isn t found but what is found i think he s going to find a trillion dollars mr musk yeah i think so the president but i think it s a very small percentage compared to what it is i mean he could tell you about treasuries he could tell you about a woman that worked for biden that became a very wealthy woman while she was working for him right mr musk yeah q yeah i know who you re talking about mr musk i mean there are some strange situations where people where you know someone s working for the government earning $ a year and then suddenly they re worth tens of millions of dollars within a few years where d the money come q how d they earn it mr musk yeah q they have a private company on the side mr musk we re just curious like can you the president while they were working mr musk can you show us because like in order to be worth tens of millions of dollars you d have to start a company or you ve got to get some kind the compensation has got to come from somewhere so how does a civil servant with earning $ a year suddenly within a span of a few years be worth tens of millions dollars q w mr musk so i just want to connect the dots here q all right s mr musk maybe there s a legitimate explanation but i don t think so laughter q so you know and this gets to kind of the heart of where i am i i looked at your work and i look at this amount of money and i get angry and i don t get v i m not an angry person mr musk sure q i don t get angry i get a i get annoyed sometimes but i don t get angry and i did live paycheck to bay paycheck a part of my life and i think of you know the working men and women in this country that the percent of which cannot afford a $ emergency after four years of harris and biden mr musk sure q okay that is serious you know financial trouble or they re putting bare necessities on credit cards and i m looking at this and i m thinking well how much when we when all is said and done we could have written a check or cut the taxes or fixed our schools mr musk yes yes q or deported these illegals that we keep finding known terrorists cartel members gang members mr musk yeah q and and we re not doing it the president sean the saddest thing is they don t talk about the individual lines i could go on your show right now i could get a list that i have on the beautiful resolute desk in the oval office and it s got points and all they are is the heading of what this money is you don t have to go deep into it and you see it s you know all different things and it s so ridiculous i mean normally when you look for fraud you re looking for one thing out of a hundred here out of a hundred are going to be bad i mean they re and they re so obvious just by the heading but they never mention that they only mention this is a violation of our constitution this is a the word they give you know it s like a sound bite constitutional crisis it s a new thing constitution but they never mention about where the money is going mr musk yes exactly the president and when people hear that i had a very smart man john kennedy he s actually a very smart man he said sir you should just go on television and just read the name of the topic that you re giving all the money just the topic that you re giving this money to and don t say anything more and he s right mr musk yeah the president and i ll do it at some point you know when but they never talk about where the money is going they just talk about it s a constitutional crisis it s so sad and honestly i think they re bad people i used to give them the benefit of the doubt but you almost think they hate the country i think they hate the country they re sick people q remember what they can t what they couldn t accomplish at the ballot box what they can t accomplish legislatively now they re using the courts mr musk yes q and they c they re trying to bury you in lawsuits the president that s right you know the good news though they ve lost their confidence they re not the same people q i think you re right the president they re they re not the same people this election was brutal for them we won every swing state we won by millions and millions of votes we won everything we all states went up all it s never happened q popular vote the president every one all states went up they ve lost their confidence i see it and they re they re just swirling and twirling they don t know what the hell is happening they re much different they re just as mean but they re not getting to the point q why do you invite them into the oval office nearly every day mr musk laughs the president well the media you re talking about the media q yeah your friends in the media the president the media no they re you know the anger that they ask questions so angry a question a normal question i give them an answer they but they i say why are you so angry when you ask a question just a standard question and i don t know there s something q they haven t had a they haven t been allowed in that office for the last four years and here you re giving them access let me go to an area that i think is key and and you talked about this in recent interviews and that is we don t need a department of education okay and what some people are trying to do is stoke fears that oh my gosh my kid is not going to get the money for education the president laughs yeah q or grandma s social security and medicare this was a big promise of yours on the campaign trail the president yeah yeah q so i really want to give you both an opportunity to assure the american people you will keep that money will be allocated for students but with higher standards for example i would assume associated with monies given or vouchers the president inaudible so much and and then elon goes but look social security won t be touched q won t be touched the president other than if there s fraud or something we re going to find it it s going to be strengthened but won t be touched medicare medicaid none of that stuff is going to be touched it s just q nothing i want you to the president inaudible don t have to now if there are illegal migrants in the system we re going to get them out of the system and all of that fraud but it s not going to be touched school i want to bring school back to the states so that iowa indiana all these places idaho new hampshire there s so many places the states i figure really run well and right now it s norway sweden denmark finland china china can you imagine has top top schools we re last so they have a list of countries we re number usually we re but last time we were number and what i say is you ve got to give it back so it doesn t work i ll tell you what we re number one in cost per pupil we spend more money than any other country by far it s not even close per pupil okay so we know it doesn t work so we spend the most and we have the worst right the worst result when we give that when we give that back to indiana when we give that b back to iowa and back to a lot of the states that run well they run well a lot of them now you re going to have laggards but you re going to have real laggards but that s going to be okay take new york you give it to westchester county you give it to suffolk county you give it to upstate new york and you give it to manhattan but you give it to four or five subsections same thing in california los angeles is going to be a problem but you re going to give it to places that run well we can change education now school choice is important but that will get care taken care of automatically we want to bring education back to the states you will spend half the number and i m not even doing this q so you re leaning more towards grants not vouchers like to parents the president i m not even i m not even doing this to save but you will save it will cost you much less money you get a much better education if you go to some of these states you ll be the equivalent of norway sweden denmark places that really have a good school system you ll have those places will be the equivalent and your overall numbers will get so much better q do you want standards associated with the money the president the only thing i want to do from from washington d c is make sure they re teaching english reading writing q math and science the president and arithmetic okay q science science might help the president okay a little science you know q computers the president you re not going to have much of a problem with that but that s it do you know we have half the buildings i mean you look at department of education mr musk it s empty the president look at the real estate and the mr musk yeah the president the level for what to to i mean for what do they do we have really bad educa the teachers i love teachers i respect teachers and by the way there s no reason why teachers can t form a union they can do whatever they want to do if it s back in the states so we re not looking to hurt the teacher i m i m going to help the teachers i think the teachers should be incentivized because a good teacher is like a good scientist is like a great doctor mr musk sure the president it s a valuable commodity mr musk yeah the president i think they should be incentivized mr musk yes the president so i m totally for the teachers mr musk absolutely q i interview a guy a lot on radio he s from wichita kansas and he started the president right q as a medical doctor started atlas md and he s now he s rolled it out nationwide concierge care $ a month hour access to a doctor the president right q you know they use a lot of telemedicine now as part of it very innovative he negotiates directly with pharmaceutical companies people if they have high blood pressure they walk out with their medicine they have high cholesterol they walk out with their medicine and they pay pennies on the dollar you mentioned the president by the way forms of that could be done q forms of that the president forms of that could be done q innovation the president we got hurt when we didn t get the vote on obamacare i made obamacare i had a choice i could let it rot and win a point or i could do the best you could do with it and that s what i did we did a great job with it and we made it sort of work but it s lousy we could do so much better and when you say you go to certain areas they they have doctors round the clock they have great medical care for a fraction of what we re paying right now there are things we could do but look just overall this man has been so valuable i hate to see the way they go after him they go after him it s so unfair he doesn t need this he wants to do this first of all this is bigger than anything he s ever done he s done great companies and all but this is much you know this is trillion everything s trillions right mr musk yeah the numbers are crazy q to go back to my original point the president he can save mr musk yeah q but let me give him his $ million back mr musk well well i no so people ask me like what s what s the what s the what s like the what s your biggest surprise in in d c and i m like the sheer scale q it s massive so you love the challenge mr musk well i mean to the president he ll never do anything bigger mr musk to the president s point the president that s the only thing you can say he ll never do anything mr musk but i mean you do something slightly better and you save billions of dollars for the american taxpayer just slightly better slightly laughs q when you say tech support mr musk you go one percent better and it s like you know tens of billions of dollars saved to the american taxpayer now if i may address the point that you the question you asked earlier which is you know how do we assure people that q they want to know mr musk yeah how do we assure people that we re going to do the right thing that their that their social security benefits will be there that their the medical care will be good and s and in fact how do we make it ensure that there s better medical care in the future how do we improve their benefits how do we make sure that their social security check goes further than it did in the past and not it doesn t get weakened by inflation so the if we if we address the the massive deficit spending the sort of the the waste in the government then then we can actually address inflation so provided the economy grows faster than the money supply which means you stop the government overspending and the waste and the output of real useful goods and services exceeds the increase in the money supply you have no inflation q yeah mr musk and and you also drop the the interest payments that people pay because if the government keeps q way too high mr musk yes the the reason the interest payments are so high is because the the national debt keeps increasing so the the government is competing for to sell debt with for with with the private citizens this drives up the interest rate so if you have a if you have a if you cut back on the deficit you actually have an amazing situation for people because you get r you get rid of inflation and you drop the interest rates and that means people s mortgage payments go down their credit card payments go down their car payments go down their student loans go down everything their their life becomes more affordable and they re standard of living improves q how quickly because i think people are suffering now we re still living under the biden harris economy the president but sean you have states right now q yeah the president you have some states that operate that way they operate as well as any corporation they really operate well mr musk yeah q florida the president they have surpluses they ha they don t mr musk texas is has a surplus for example q yeah the president when they when they look at new york and and california and some of these places that should have an advantage i mean there s a big advantage or pritzker does such a bad job in illinois it s horrible how bad he is and they don t have that advantage you know new york has stock exchange and a lot of things and california has the weather and the beautiful water and all the thing mr musk california has has great weather the most expensive weather on earth the president yeah laughter but but q i like florida mr musk yeah the president but some states operate the way he s talking about q efficiently the president when you go into some of these states you re going to find very little you re going to find almost nothing they really operate well big surpluses low taxes and q you know my taxes went up the first time you were president because you took away the salt deduction the president i well i did q which by the way i thought was the right decision the president it was the right decision in fact reagan tried to do it because it rewards badly run states but at the same time it s a tough it was it s tough for the states i mean it really is tough for the states the sad part is it rewards really badly run states q yeah the president and reagan tried to do it he was unable to do it i got it done q you got it done and the president and now we re going to give some back q a little bit the president because you know what we ve got to help them q it s only a little the president we ve got to help q because otherwi we re encouraging people to elect high taxes spen the president nobody had any idea it would be that devastating i did the right thing i got something that reagan couldn t do i got it done where everybody is are the same but you know what we ve got to help them out q reagan had the grace commission some of the best business minds in the country the president right q and they came up with recommendations congress adopted none of them and none of them were implemented i ve got to ask this question because the media is obsessed about it what what if there is a conflict in other words because you do business it was funny when it came out the other day that there was going to be i think $ million billio i don t know if it was millions or billions a lot of money on teslas that joe biden s administration w did with tesla and mr musk i m not familiar with that q you re not even familiar with it but mr musk i i don t think are you talking about like the inflation reduction act stuff or q it was some it was a purchase order of tesla vehicles mr musk oh oh that was that was incorrect there was s like there s some sort of the media claim that there was like $ million worth of cybertrucks q that was it mr musk being bought by the dod q and that he gave it to you mr musk no well first of all that was the president no actually it was mr musk th it was fa the president it was biden q it was biden the president and you know biden wouldn t give him much mr musk but but it wasn t even it was fake news six weeks to sunday tesla is not getting $ million for cybertrucks and the and the and this alleged q that s what it was cybertrucks mr musk this yeah this alleged award occurred in december before the president took office so it s it s fake on multiple levels there i tesla isn t getting $ million and even if it even if it was which it isn t it was awarded during the biden administration q okay but you re you you mr musk it s total fake news q there there is mr musk it s fake on like it s like multiple leverals q there is some integration mr musk multiple layers of fake q so you re you re tasked now and i pray to god this is successful i really do i wish you godspeed mr musk yeah q you know godspeed john glenn the president it s it s going to be by the way i really believe it s going to be q but but there mr musk oh yeah q but there are legitimate areas the president because the country is going to do well beside this this is cutting we re only talking about cutting we re also going to make a lot of money we re g we re taking in so much money q but what about his business what if if there is the president then we won t let him do it q a contract he would otherwise get the president we re not going to let him do it he if q you re not going to let him do it the president if he s got a conflict i mean look he q y now y the president he s in certain areas i mean i see this morning i didn t i didn t know but i said do the right thing where they re cutting way back on the electric vehicle subsidies mr musk yes the president they re cutting back q you re losing the president not only cutting back q it hurts you mr musk correct the president yeah now i will tell you q you don t care mr musk well the president he s probably not that happy with it but that would have been one thing he would have come to me and said listen you got to do me a favor this is crazy laughter but this was in the tax bill they re cutting back on the subsidies i didn t i wasn t involved in it i said do what s right and you get and they re coming up with the tax but it s just preliminary but i mean if he were involved wouldn t you think he d probably do that now maybe he does better if you cut back on the subsidies who knows because he figures he does think differently he thinks he has a better product and as long as he has a level playing field he doesn t care what you do mr musk exactly the president which he s very he s told me that mr musk yeah i mean i haven t asked the president for anything ever the president it s true q and if it comes up how how will you handle it inaudible the president he won t be involved mr musk yeah i ll i ll re i ll recuse myself if it is a conflict the president if there s a conflict he won t be involved mr musk yeah the president i mean i wouldn t want that and he won t want it mr musk right and and also i m getting a sort of a daily proctology exam here you know it s not like i ll be getting away from something in the dead of night q welcome to d c if you want a friend get a dog mr musk well i do have a dog but i also have friends laughter my dog loves me poor little creature the president you know the truth was mr musk i need to bring him to d c the president he s i know every businessman i know the the good ones the bad ones the smart ones the lucky ones i know them all this guy is a ver he s a brilliant guy he s a great guy he s got tremendous imagination and scientific imagin far beyond you know you keep talking about a technologist and all but you re much more than a technologist you are that but he s also a good person he s a very good person and he wants to see the country do well and i know a lot of great businesspeople really great business people but you know they re not really in some cases very good people and i know people that would try and take advantage of the situation this guy is somebody that really cares for the country and i saw that very early on i saw it really a long time ago when i got to know him he s a very different kind of a character that s why you know who loves him young people that are very smart and that love the country he s got like a tremendous following because that s what he s he s a good person and he doesn t need this he didn t need this and he s doing this to help the country if i didn t win this election this country was i don t think it could have made it i don t i mean we re allowing criminals millions of criminals into our country where everything is transgender it s men playing in women s sports i mean none of this stuff you could go i could give you a hundred things it s almost like they re trying to destroy the fabric of of the country of the world because the world was following us now the world is following us out of this pit we ve done a lot i ll tell you what in three weeks we ve done more i think we ve done more in in terms of meaningful not just dollars than maybe any president ever and a lot of people are saying that q shock it s been shock and awe the president i mean if we can keep it going at this level this country is going to be at a level that it s never seen before q you know one of the things you did that i really thought was pretty clever and smart and fair and that was reciprocal tariffs the president yeah reciprocal q ta i didn t know india charged so much i didn t know the european union to charge them mr musk yeah totally q i didn t know canada was charging us the president everybody everybody everybody but us q brazil why the president and i was doing it you know i charged china tariffs i took in hundreds of billions of dollars and i was doing that but when we got we had the greatest economy in history but then we got hit with covid and we had to solve that problem because i was doing it and now i said i want to come back and do the recipri because every country in the world almost we have a deficit with almost every country not every one but just about pretty close and but every country in the world takes advantage of us and they do it with tariffs they makes make it it s impossible for him to sell a car practically in as an example india i don t know if that s true or not but i think mr musk the tariffs are like percent import duty the president the tariffs are so high mr musk yeah the president they don t want to now if he built the factory in india that s okay but that s unfair to us it s very unfair and i said you know what we do i told prime minister modi yesterday he was here i said here s what you do we re going to do be very fair with you they charge the highest tariffs in the world just about q percent the president oh much much higher mr musk it s percent on auto imports are percent the president yeah that s peanuts so much higher and and others too i said here s what we re going to do reciprocal whatever you charge i m charging he goes no no i don t like that no no whatever you charge i m going to charge i m doing that with every country mr musk it seems fair q don t you the president laughs it does mr musk it s it s like fair is fair the president nobody can argue with me you know the media can t argue i said they said tariffs you re going to charge tariffs you know if i said like percent they d say oh that s terrible i don t say that anymore q can i inaudible the president because i say whatever they charge we ll charge and you know what q they stop the president they then they say oh that sounds fair mr musk all the president is saying is that q inaudible mr musk it needs to be at a level playing field and and fair and square q yeah and how does how the president and we re going to make a lot of money and a lot of businesses are going to come pouring in mr musk how can you argue with a fair and square situation q don t don t you think most of them will look at the the for example without america china s economy will tank they need our business the president they do everybody needs us q everybody needs it the president and you know what q do don t you think they ll stop the president we only have so long left where we re in this position we re the bank and the bank is getting smaller and smaller and smaller we we re the bank we got to do this now we can t wait another years and have a shell of a country left because that s what was going to happen q mr president the president this country if i didn t win this election and have people like this man right here that really do care because that s the other word if you don t care you could be the smartest guy in the world it s not going to matter but if we didn t win this election i m telling you we would not have had a country for very long q how quickly mr musk may i say q do you balance the budget and and when do we start paying down that debt the president well potentially very quickly between what he s doing and with income coming in from tariffs and other things i mean i hope we can i don t want to give a date because then these people are going to say oh well he didn t make the date but i think we can do it very quickly we would have never done it if this didn t happen never it would have never been it would only get worse and worse and ultimately it would have exploded this country was headed down a very bad track and the whole dei thing that was that was a trap that was a sick trap q inaudible mr musk inaudible the president and you know we ve destroyed that that s gone that s pretty much gone q i agree mr musk inaudible q we re not we re not funding it mr musk if i really want to i really want to emphasize to people that this is a very important point if we don t solve the deficit there won t be money for medical care there won t be money the president right mr musk for social security we either solve the deficit or all we ll be doing is paying debt q nobody mr musk it s it s got to be solved or there s no medical care there s no social security there s no nothing that s got to be solved it s not optional america will go bankrupt if this is not done that s why i m here q the president s the president europe takes advantage of us mr musk and and i d like to also just send a message like because as the president said like this there s a lot of rich people out there they should be caring more about the country because the reason they should be caring about more about country is america falls what do you think is going to happen to your business what do what do you think do you think you re be going to be okay if if the ship of america sinks of course not like what what i m doing here what the president is doing is it s just long term thinking the ship of america must be strong the ship of america cannot sink if it sinks we all sink with it the president sean you re a q this is what this is what drives you mr musk yes q this is important it says tech support so you re not trying to be president as the media suggests you are really here because your heart and your passion is this and the president described you as being this is the biggest thing you ever done now you trying to bring sight to the president there could be nothing bigger there s nothing q you re sending ships up to mars you know spaceships up in the sky all the time the president that s peanuts q and saving astronauts that s pretty big the president that s peanuts compared to what we re talking about q it s peanuts the president yeah q do you agree with that mr musk well it s esse it s essential that america be healthy that america s economy be strong and and if that if basically like my concern is like if if america is the central pillar holding up western civilization that pillar must be strong if that pillar falls the whole roof comes crashing down the president including his ships mr musk there s no place to hide the president including his ships going up mr musk there s no place to run the president nothing there s nothing left q why why if this is your goal your motivation you re losing money in the process you re offeri you do all these nice things for people for free you re trying to solve you know blindness you re going to rescue astronauts you help the people in north carolina california you re cutting money that was sent abroad that s not helping the american people then why the rage mr musk actually i think it was like q but why this rage mr musk it was not helping the american people and hurting people overseas to be clear q why this rage against you now first they hated him now they hate both of you mr musk well i think we re seeing an antibody reaction from from those who are receiving the the wasteful and fraudulent money q they re being exposed mr musk yes q nobody wants to be exposed when you re corrupt mr musk i ll i ll tell you a lesson i learned at paypal you know who complained the loudest the quickest and the loudest and with the most amount of righteous indignation the fraudsters that s who complained first loudest and and they would generally have this immense overreaction that s how we knew there were the fraudsters that s how we knew there s a tell q what di i ve never i ve never met you before today mr musk yeah q and it s nice to meet you by the way thank thank you for doing this you guys are really friends i could s you guys i could see you kicking up your shoes the president well he doesn t do this kind of thing and the way i figured that you d get to know him is if i did it with him i said come on let s do it together he doesn t do this i think he s smarter not doing it overall because you know i mean he s done very well without doing it but he doesn t feel it s really worthwhile he wants the product to speak for itself or whatever he does speak for itself but he views it as you know does it matter and i m doing this with you today because i wanted to have people understand him and i think it s very important i disagree with him i think it s very important that they do understand him he doesn t need this he doesn t need it now i happen to think it s made him very popular i think it he s more popular now because there are so many people you know you re talking about the radical left they have the lowest ratings msnbc is dying cnn is dying they re all dying the new york times is doing lousy the washington post is doing horribly they re all doing badly because people don t buy it anymore but i think it was important that he do this one interview you ve been a very fair guy i think you were the right guy to do it if we could get some radical left guy and he d do just as well frankly because it s all about common sense q they would attack him the president but this sean q as being unconstitutional not a fascist the president to me this was a it was important for people to understand he s doing a big job he s doing a very thankless job he s doing a thankless job but he s helping us to save our country our country was in serious trouble and i had to get the best guy somebody with credibility because if he were just a regular good very good solid businessman he wouldn t have the credibility he s got the best credibility for this and people also know he s an honest guy he s an honest guy he s just a very very smart guy who s done amazing things and this will be the biggest thing he s ever done because you know his companies are all great but if this country goes bad i guess where he is a little selfish is this he knows one thing and probably doesn t think but if his if this country goes bad his stuff is not going to be worth very much i can tell you mr musk well i d say if the if the ship of america sinks we re all go going down with it you know this idea that people can escape to new zealand or some other place is false if the central pillar of western civilization that is america falls the whole roof comes crashing down and there is no escape q it s amazing since you ve been elected to watch canada mexico venezuela colombia i i was shocked at the statements that vladimir putin made about you i i was shocked at the hostage release i was shocked that venezuela had done it had done it zelenskyy wants a deal putin wants a deal the president all good statements q king abdullah was interested the president you mean by that all good statements look they respect the president of this country they respect they did not respect the last president they laughed at him and they laughed at our country and he s done great damage to our country q have foreign leaders told you what they thought of biden the president yeah they have but i d rather not say they they have it s not it look q it s the obvious the president he was not george washington let s put it that way mr musk inaudible the president not the greatest q sorry if that s inaudible the president he s done a tremendous disservice q will you be here the president and by the way the democrats have done a great disservice and they ought to get their act together and use a little judgment and they ought to work with us on straightening out this mess that q who john fetterman the president a lot of people have q maybe who what democrat is not radicalized the president actually you mention john q john fetterman the president he s become the best voice in the democrat party you know i had lunch with him and i thought he was terrific but he s a much different man than he was before he had this difficulty he used to be radical left and i think he became much smarter actually he s really he s really a voice of reason but the democrats have to get together they have to get their act together because the stuff they they talk about makes no sense it makes none whatsoever and they must know it they must know mr musk yeah i mean like the country has spoken very clearly and rejected the core tenets of the demo democratic party the country voted t fo i mean the country made the america has made its vote clear the president won the popular vote decisively the republicans won the house repub republicans won the senate what more do you need the democratic party needs to take a hard look in the mirror and and change their ways q i think they went from shock denial into the depression stage of grief and now they re in the rage stage where i anticipate they ll stay for four years and if they get the chance they ll want to impeach him times do you anticipate you ll be here in four years my last question mr musk i ll i ll be as helpful as long as i can be helpful the president that s a good question i mean i was thinking about that just now i said i wonder how long he s going to be doing it you can t get somebody like this he cares and he s brilliant and he s got energy you need energy also in addition to those other things you know i have a lot of guys that are very smart but they have no energy they want to sleep all day long you need a lot of energy he s got a lot of energy he s doing a great job if there s any conflict he he will stop it but if he didn t i d stop it i d see if there s a conflict i mean we re talking about big stuff but he s under a pretty big microscope mr musk yeah seriously the president i mean everybody is watching him if there s a conflict you re going to be reading about it within about two minutes after the conflict mr musk exactly there there s the possibility of me getting away with something is percent i i m scrutinized to a ridiculous degree and and the other thing is that we you know what what s you know what s better than saying trust trust me is just full transparency so what we re doing with with the doge doge dot just go to doge gov you can see every single action that s being taken and now and i want to be clear we are going to make some mistakes we re not going to be perfect nobody bats a thousand but we re going to fix the mistakes very quickly that s what matters not that you don t make mistakes but that you fix the mistakes very fast the president and you re going to ask the other side when they talk about this is a constitutional crisis you got to a what are they paying for where are those tax because when you read off the list of things it s a big con job see when they talk constitution mr musk totally the president it s a total con job mr musk yes the president they never talk and i watch some of the shows mr musk it s specifics they avoid specifics the president yeah when you start talking about how did how come they spent money on transgender here and transgender there mr musk yeah totally the president and all the stuff in some country that nobody ever heard of they don t want to talk about it they just talk about this is a constitutional crisis q it shocks the conscious the president the money is being squandered purposely tremendous theft tremendous kickbacks everything and we re straightening it out and thank goodness i look up and i say thank you because i think if it went on for four more years it would not be salvageable you wouldn t be able mr musk absolutely the president you wouldn t be able to save it q you believe too that when you were in butler came within a millimeter being assassinated the president yeah q the day you endorsed him that was that day mr musk yes q but you had been planning on it mr musk yeah q pretty i think everybody will never forget that iconic blood on your face fight fight fight i actually was afra watching it and thought you might drop again you know i didn t know if it had hit you you can sometimes get up and then the blood starts to accumulate it was scary pretty scary mr musk well i mean th this is how you know someone s true character because everyone can say they re brave but the president was actually shot okay courage under fire fight fight fight blood streaming down the face that s true courage you can t fake that q yeah thank you both mr president thank you sir the president thank you very much q appreciate it elon thank you for your time really nice to meet you na

Tariffs Work — and President Trump’s First Term Proves It For the first time in decades, the United States will see fair trade as President Donald J. Trump announces tariffs to level the playing field for American workers and businesses.
Tariffs Work — and President Trump’s First Term Proves It Despite the rhetoric from politicians and the media, studies have repeatedly shown tariffs are an effective tool for achieving economic and strategic objectives — just as they did in President Trump’s first term.
Tariffs Work — and President Trump’s First Term Proves It Despite the rhetoric from politicians and the media, studies have repeatedly shown tariffs are an effective tool for achieving economic and strategic objectives — just as they did in President Trump’s first term.
Tariffs Work — and President Trump’s First Term Proves It A 2024 study on the effects of President Trump’s tariffs in his first term found that they “strengthened the U.S. economy” and “led to significant reshoring” in industries like manufacturing and steel production.
A 2023 report by the U.S. International Trade Commission — which analyzed the effects of President Trump’s Section 232 and 301 tariffs on more than $300 billion of U.S. imports — found the tariffs reduced imports from China, effectively stimulated more U.S. production of the affected goods, and had very minor effects on downstream prices.
According to the Economic Policy Institute, the tariffs implemented by President Trump during his first term “clearly show[ed] no correlation with inflation” and had only a fleeting effect on overall prices.
Economic Policy Institute: “Following implementation of Sec. 232 measures in 2018—and prior to the global downturn in 2020—U.S. steel output, employment, capital investment, and financial performance all improved. In particular, U.S. steel producers announced plans to invest more than $15.7 billion in new or upgraded steel facilities, creating at least 3,200 direct new jobs, many of which are now poised to come online.”
An analysis by the Atlantic Council found that “tariffs would create new incentives for US consumers to buy US-made products.”
Former Biden Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen affirmed last year that tariffs do not raise prices: “I don’t believe that American consumers will see any meaningful increase in the prices that they face.”
A 2024 economic analysis found that a global tariff of 10% would grow the economy by $728 billion, create 2.8 million jobs, and increase real household incomes by 5.7%.
President Trump’s first term steel tariffs led to thousands of jobs gains in the metal industry, along with wage increases.
The tariffs were hailed as a “boon” for Minnesota’s iron ore industry, with state officials crediting them for bolstering the local economy.
Steel and aluminum imports drastically decreased during President Trump’s first term, falling by nearly one-third from 2016 to 2020.
The tariffs led to a wave in investment across the United States, with more than $10 billion committed to build new mills.

S&P Global: “Global Trade At A Crossroads: Trump Tariffs Forge Better Credit Quality For U.S.-Based Steel And Aluminum Producers With A Protectionist Stance”
IndustryWeek: “Tariffs Are Keeping US Steel Production Strong”
“With steel imports down, America’s steelmakers have started investing at home. In addition to Nucor and US Steel, companies like Cleveland-Cliffs, Steel Dynamics, CMC, and AK Steel have invested billions of dollars in at least 16 major new projects throughout the nation. The top five US steel companies more than doubled their total annual investments between 2017 to 2019, from $1.5 billion to $4.2 billion.”

Tariffs Work — and President Trump’s First Term Proves It PBS (2018): “Trump tariffs may imperil a delicate global economic rebound”
“President Donald Trump’s announcement Thursday that the United States would impose heavy tariffs on imported steel and aluminum — with some countries potentially exempted — suddenly raised a fear that few had anticipated: That U.S. tariffs could trigger a chain of tit-for-tat retaliation by America’s trading partners that could erupt into a full-blown trade war and possibly threaten the global economy.”
NPR (2018): “Trump Plan To Impose Tariffs on Steel, Aluminum Raises Trade War Fears”
“Chad Bown, an economist and trade specialist, says the tariffs will drive up the price of steel and aluminum for the multiple other industries that use the metals. Those industries actually employ more people than the steel and aluminum sectors, he says, ‘so this is a really big concern, just from an economic perspective.’”
The New Yorker (2019): “Trump’s Trade War Could Make the Trump Recession a Reality”
“What we do know for sure is that, the longer Donald Trump persists in his trade war, the greater the chances are of an outright slump developing.”
